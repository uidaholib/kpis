ATS Team, Academic Year 2024-2025
Last updated 6/16/2025
**Overview:**
The ATS Team coordinates work between the access and technical services units of the library to ensure
resources are available to patrons in a timely fashion and that the library’s catalog accurately reflects
what is on the shelves.
**Relevant Library KPIs:**
- Course reserves
- Electronic resources
- Online catalog
- Physical circulation
**Objectives:**
**● Objective #1:**
  - Ensure optimal workflows between access and technical services activities
  - Why:
▪ To ensure patrons have timely access to needed materials
▪ To ensure accuracy between the library’s catalog and the library’s shelves.
  - How:
▪ Coordinate steps between processing and shelving new materials.
▪ Coordinate training and supervision of student employees performing ATS and
mailroom tasks.
▪ Coordinate the withdrawal/catalog deletion of withdrawn physical materials.
▪ Coordinate activities for the relocation/re-cataloging of any physical material
collections.
▪ Coordinates searches for lost and missing items and ensure catalog reflects
most current status.
▪ Regularly review “in transit” items.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Quick turnaround between material arrival and shelving.
▪ Limited errors in cataloging and availability of materials on shelves.
▪ Limited “in transit” for longer than 30 days.
**Fall Update:**

**● Metrics:**
  - # of new physical materials received/shelved
▪ 1322 periodical issues
▪ 714 books/serials
  - # of physical materials withdrawn
▪ 1315 item records deleted
  - # of lost and missing items:
▪ Lost Status: 661
▪ Missing Status: 674
**Access Services:**
- This Fall Aarika extensively searched for lost and missing books, even going so far as to bring in a
video camera that could look between the shelving units! We are due for another extensive
search this March over spring recess. Haley has done an exceptional job this Fall, training
students in mending and newspaper processing. She trained 4 students in mending and 5 in
how to process papers. This has had a significant impact on the turnaround time for both
workloads. There are still a few outliers on the “in transit” status, but I have been able to
notably reign it in and mostly determine where and why we were having so many long-term
issues.
**Technical Services:**
- Standard procedure continued unabated in Fall 2024, with additions and withdrawals
proceeding as usual. Abby Kirkham, Rachel Kerr, and Clinton Johnson spearheaded a digitization
effort of 20 different regional newspapers requested by Ancestry that included hundreds of rolls
of microfilm being shipped out and reshelved upon return. Matthew Strupp began the process
of aiding the Herbarium in copy cataloguing their Botanical Library for ease of access. Samantha
Thompson-Franklin and Clinton worked to set up an Evidence Based Acquisition e Book plan with
IGI Global.
**Spring Update:**
**● Metrics:**
  - # of new physical materials received/shelved
▪ 1575 periodical issues
▪ 1029 books/serials
  - # of physical materials withdrawn
▪ 1401 item records deleted Spring 2025
- An additional 4950 volumes were withdrawn during Fall/Spring 24/25
that did not have item records to account for in Analytics
  - # of lost and missing items:
▪ Lost Status: 554
▪ Missing Status: 686

**Access Services:**
- The students that trained in the Fall for mail room tasks (papers, periodicals, donations and
mending) have done an exceptional job managing the workflow. Our “lost” items were down by
over 100 from Fall to Spring and our “missing” materials only increased by 12. We are still
working to determine why some materials are in a prolonged “in-transit” status and Lex has
volunteered to track the issues on a more frequent basis going forward.
**Technical Services:**
- This Spring saw the continuation of the cataloguing work Matthew has been doing for the
Herbarium, as well as a new project processing an initial batch of titles for the new SPEC Kolln
Collection of books by and about women. Rachel Kerr continued withdrawals in accordance
with the needs of the WEST Archive and continued the work of withdrawing targeted periodicals
on 2nd to coincide with the ongoing space optimization analysis. Additionally, Rachel and Clinton
aided in the emergency relocation and withdrawal of materials affected by the Spring flooding
incident in the basement. IGI Global EBA e Books plan reached its conclusion with the addition
of 28 new e Book titles.
**Final Outcomes:**
- AY 24-25 proved to be very successful in satisfying our Teams objective of optimizing workflow
between Access Services and Technical Services. The additional use of our students in the
mailroom was our most prominent success. We no longer have donations, periodicals and
papers piling up for days and not making it onto the shelves for weeks. We now have a daily
turnover for these materials. Lost, missing and In-transit materials stayed fairly stable
throughout the year which is also a positive and indicative that our processing, and handling of
materials is functioning well.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
Hiring a new lead and implementing Rapido in ILL will present both a challenge and a wealth of
opportunity for their unit. Access Services plans to reinvigorate the lost/missing/in-transit workflows in
hopes to determine a more meaningful metric for tracking in the coming year. Fall 2025 should see the
completion of the bulk of the Herbarium Botanical Library copy cataloging project. Technical services
would be happy to assist should the Herbarium require additional copy cataloging for new materials.
