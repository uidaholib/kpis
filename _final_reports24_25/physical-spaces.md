Physical Spaces and Public Programming Team
Academic Year 2024-2025
Last updated 06/16/2025
**Overview:**
The Physical Spaces and Public Programming Team seeks to provide safe, usable, and accessible
public spaces for U of I affiliates and community members who visit the UI Library in-person.
They make space recommendations to library leadership based on local space assessments and
national library trends. They also oversee the physical use of the building for programming and
events.
**Library KPIs:**
- Exhibits (Primary responsibility)
- Building usage (Relevant)
**Meeting Agenda:**
- 2024-25 Physical Spaces & Public Programming Agenda.docx
**Objectives:**
*Fall updates in blue.
*Spring updates in pink.
**● OBJECTIVE #1:**
  - Ensure accessible and usable spaces that meet the diverse needs of Library
patrons by collecting and analyzing data on usage and by monitoring trends
(local and national) over time.
**➢ Why:**
▪ Ensure the campus community and public patrons have adequate space
to meet their educational needs.
**➢ How:**
▪ Provide reservable spaces that meet the diverse needs of U of I students.
▪ Prioritized recommendations to remedy and/or improve areas where
accessibility is problematic.
▪ Address building issues reported by employees and patrons.
▪ Maintain relationship with campus safety operations.
▪ Walk-through conducted at the end of each semester to document
building and furniture issues (like broken chairs, damaged white boards,
etc.) that need to be addressed.
▪ Ensure brand unity in library signage.
▪ Updates made to the Library Floor Maps on an as-needed basis.
**➢ Success looks like:**
▪ Steady or increasing usage of library public spaces.
**➢ Fall Updates:**

▪ Lib Cal reservations are being utilized.
▪ Groups inquiring about spaces are being referred to the appropriate PSPP
members and relevant Access Services staff.
▪ We are prioritizing accessibility on the first floor for this year.
- Column at Circulation Desk, cuts off view of front desk from staff
stations. This sometimes leads to slow service for patrons.
♦ Could this column be reduced in size for better visual
access?
- The display cases filled with SPEC items on the first floor by the
genre cubbies do not allow easy access for wheelchair users to go
around them and they block visual access to the MILL.
♦ The recommendation is to move them elsewhere in the
building and put in their place another study table as this
front area is very popular with students.
▪ Campus Safety/building issues: From Samm’s email regarding the last
inspection: “email from Beau and he did let me know that all of the items
form our list from last year had been addressed on the department
level.”
▪ Walkthrough to be conducted at the end of Spring 2025.
▪ Standardized flyers have been created and placed in Share Point by a
previous Spaces Team member.
▪ Blank floor plans have been sent over from facilities. The PSPP team will
update them to reflect the evacuation meet-up point outside of Renfrew.
**➢ Spring Updates:**
▪ Walkthrough of all 4 floors and the Special Collections Offices conducted.
- PSPP Team members split into pairs.
♦ Each pair had a checklist to take notes.
➢ See Share Point for pdf, link below.
▪ 2025_Library.Walk-Thru.Checklist
- Priority items to address:
♦ See Appendix for photos correlating to Priority Items.
♦ Study Booth cushions on first and second floor are used
very often and are ripping at the seams.
➢ There is also one booth (possibly removed for
damage) from 1st floor, southside, facing MILL.
♦ Metallic silver chairs in the living room area show wear.
♦ Purple benches by computer lab on first floor show wear.
♦ Monday morning cleaning rotation. Can we get priority?
➢ Carpet on 4th floor – stains throughout.
➢ Carpet in Renfrew Presentation space.
➢ Carpet by Circulation and Reference area.
➢ Vacuuming beneath booths.
➢ Wiping tables.
➢ Trash throughout all floors.

- Miscellaneous items:
♦ Small wall scrapes and dings.
♦ Air filter replacement in Team Rm 2.
♦ Missing corner guard/corner protector on 4th floor.
♦ Missing glass board tray in Team Rm 2.
♦ Floor signs.
➢ Temporary updates as needed for changes to
floors.
▪ Reference Desk shift to 2nd floor.
▪ Studio moved to 1st floor.
**▪ Possible change:**
- Graphic novels and Travel Guides
moved to 1st floor.
▪ Evacuation Floor Maps.
- Originally going to redo from blank floor maps.
- Victoria Kerr forwarded along revised maps from 2023.
♦ Kelley Moulton edited to show correct meetup position.
- All Evacuation Floor Maps have been replaced on all floors.
**Metrics:**
➢ # of patrons using spaces, including:
▪ Study rooms and graduate carrels.
▪ Public spaces on the 1st – 4th floors.
▪ Metrics will be broken down further for the End-Year Report.
- Full metrics here: Space Count Fall 2024 & SPRING 2025.xlsx
- According to the floor counts conducted by Access Services, Fall
2024 and Spring 2025: These numbers include individual/group
study rooms and open study areas on all 4 floors of the Library.
♦ September = 8,657
♦ October = 15,050
♦ November = 10,578
♦ December = 6,722
♦ January = 9,459
♦ February = 11,629
♦ March = 8,423
♦ April = 11,283
♦ May = 2,355
▪ Data Hub/Map Room.
- Fall 2024 (usage for entire semester)
♦ Count of people using Data Hub w/ Events = 889.
♦ Count of people using Data Hub w/o Events = 614.
- Spring 2025:
♦ Average daily count of Data Hub use w/o Events = 10.

♦ Count of people using Data Hub w/o Events = 823.
➢ Language from Excel sheet shared by Jeremy
Kenyon: space Usage_aggregate Data.xlsx
▪ New data points used rather than those
placed in 2024-25 PSPP Mid Year Report.
▪ GSCC.
- Suzie tracks patrons in the space by an hourly tally sheet which is
used as the Gate Count, so this would be a redundant count.
➢ # of building issues reported.
▪ Discussed creating an excel to track these, however we worried it would
be more work than was necessary.
- Rami Attebury created Auto-populating Excel Sheet to list any
issue that is forwarded along to the lib-bldg email address.
♦ All issues forwarded to UI Facilities will include CC: the lib-
bldg email address starting Fall 2025, so as to populate
Rami’s Excel sheet.
▪ Reached out directly to UI Facilities and they reported back:
- 58 were in response to issues or special requests.
- ## response to issues or special requests.
➢ # of furniture issues identified.
▪ Not available right now, Facilities just reported the number of issues, not
what they were about.
▪ Furniture issues addressed in Spring 2025 walkthroughs:
- 14 booths to replace for student study spaces, 1st and 2nd floors.
♦ 24 booths total in Library, if we want to have all the
booths updated all at once.
- 6 purple benches near 1st floor Living Room space.
- 4 metallic silver chair cushions in 1st floor Living Room space.
▪ See Appendix for all issues and correlating photographic evidence.
➢ Gate count Main and GSCC.
▪ Main: 122,195 (August 18 – December 31, 2024)
▪ GSCC: 924 (August 18 – December 31, 2024)
▪ Main: 129,308 (January 1 – May 10, 2025)
▪ GSCC: 670 (January 1 – May 10, 2025)
● OBJECTIVE #2: Provide oversight for space use related to programming and events, such
as the colloquium series, external workshops, public readings, therapy dogs, tabling, etc.
**➢ Why:**
▪ Ensure the campus community and public patrons have adequate space
to meet their educational needs.
**➢ How:**
▪ Communicate with event organizers and access services staff to
coordinate space reservations and any needed furniture arrangement.

**➢ Success looks like:**
▪ Consistent programming throughout the year that enriches the
educational environment of the campus and public community.
▪ Utilizing attendance metrics to guide programming decisions.
**➢ Fall 2024 Updates:**
▪ When events pop up, the appropriate folks have been looped in, Jylisa,
Alisa, and the PSPP Team Lead. An example of this: when the NASC study
coordinator reached out for repeat reservations for the current semester.
▪ Why we crossed out the final bullet point under “success looks like”
please see note under Metrics for “# of attendees”.
- Programming decisions can be discussed later on with the
Associate Dean, Rami Attebury.
**➢ Spring 2025 Updates:**
▪ Reservations for 1st floor tabling space have been addressed.
- New Microsoft Form for tabling to be implemented Fall 2025.
- Another check to keep track of which student groups/campus
offices use the main UI Library for promotion and/or club
activities. To use in conjunction with Lib Cal.
▪ Renfrew presentation space used for displaying student work from
HIST424.
- Sensing Place: An Environmental History Exhibit.
♦ Photos in Share Point for context.
➢ 05_Sensing.Place_HIST424
**Metrics:**
❖ # of events (Fall 2024)
➢ 17 - Renfrews/Read-Ins.
➢ 25 - ETIL workshops.
➢ 06 - Graduate Student Essentials.
➢ 05 - Data Hub Talks.
➢ 04 - visits from Therapy Dogs.
➢ 02 - student groups tabling.
➢ 59 = total.
❖ # of events (Spring 2025)
➢ 13 - Renfrews/Read-Ins.
➢ 39 ETIL workshops.
➢ 10 - Data Hub Talks (5)/IIDS presentations (5).
➢ 05 - visits from campus offices: Therapy Dogs (4)/Health Hut (1).
➢ 05 - UI affiliated groups tabling.
▪ Taste of Nepal = 8 days.
▪ UI Geology Club = 2 days.
▪ International Programs Office = 1 day.
▪ Study Abroad Office = 2 days.

▪ India Student Organization = 4 days.
➢ 01 - Miscellaneous (presentation on 1st floor).

➢ # of attendees
▪ There is not an efficient way to do this as not every event is attended
by a PSPP Team Member, so we cannot keep accurate numbers.
**Team/Unit Members:**
- Bruce Godfrey
- Samm Green
- Haley Hunter
- Kelley Moulton
- Tyler Rodrigues
- Rochelle Smith
- Kelly Omodt, Team Lead
**Reporting to:**
- Rami Attebury
**Final Outcomes:**
❖ We’re seeing consistent use of all four floors. Sponsored events seem to be well
attended.
❖ Our study spaces are so well loved by students that we need to replace some furniture.
➢ Mainly booth cushions on 1st and 2nd floors, as well as a few seating areas in the
Living Room on 1st floor.
❖ Our building is so well used it deserves some TLC in return.
➢ Mainly in the form of cleaning – see final point under the next section.
Challenges & Opportunities for Next Year:
❖ A challenge is accurately tracking building issues within the main UI Library, the team
will brainstorm on how to efficiently track these filed issues without being added to the
lib-bldg email list.
➢ With the implementation of Rami’s auto-populated Excel sheet, this issue may
be addressed in the following year.
❖ An opportunity is expanding partnerships across campus and inviting other disciplines to
use the 1st floor presentation space.
➢ The opportunity arose with HIST424 professor, Dr. Kreikemeier, reaching out to
showcase student work along with an opening reception on 1st floor of the main
UI Library, in the Renfrew presentation area, Sensing Place.
▪ This event/exhibit can be used as an example going forward.
❖ Monday Morning Cleaning Rotation from UI Facilities:

➢ Appendix, Figure 3: examples to demonstrate the need of extra cleaning.
▪ Deep clean of the following:
- Carpet on 4th floor – stains throughout.
- Carpet in Renfrew Presentation space.
- Carpet by Circulation and Reference areas.
**▪ Weekly cleaning needs:**
- Vacuuming beneath booths.
- Wiping study tables in all rooms.
- Trash throughout all floors (bathrooms included).
♦ Could the above 3 tasks be completed late Sunday night or
early Monday morning?
➢ It has been noted by several staff and faculty
members that the weekend trash is not emptied by
Monday morning.
➢ The UI Library keeps late hours to foster student
accessibility to resources and overall student
success. Having a clean space adds to the
accessibility and appreciation of our space.

Appendix
Photographs in Order of Prioritized Tasks
Figure 1: Booth Cushions.
Note: Have we always had this booth missing, or was it removed a while ago?
Note: The 8 seat cushions on 2nd floor in worst
conditions were originally on the 1st floor, by public elevator, relocated to 2nd floor in 2021.
Figure 2: Living Room Furniture

Note: Purple benches near computer lab, edges breaking down.
Note: Seat cushions for metallic chairs are cracking, possibly replace only the seats?
Figure 3: Cleanliness

Note: One example of where stains are showing on carpet.
Note: Included to show that the floor beneath the study booths has not been vacuumed.
Figure 4: Walls

Note: This corner wall protector is in the Library Admin Office, Samm Green will be placing a
ticket to fix this in early May, 2025.
Sidenote: The walls on every floor contain scuff marks related to patron use, either from chairs,
shoes, bags, tables, etc. Photos not included but wanted to make the remark that these scuff
marks have been noticed and will keep an eye if they develop into scrapes or cracks, see final
photo under “Figure 5”.
Figure 5: Too small to fix?

Note: titled “too small to fix?” because they are low on the priority list, but I wanted to bring it
to Admin attention just in case; as well as document how many of these small maintenance
issues crop up over an academic year.
Note: Both on 1st floor.

Note: small ding in wall, not quite a hole.
Note: scrape along wall – will sanding and repainting be enough?
