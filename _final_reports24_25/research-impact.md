**RESEARCH IMPACT TEAM**
**Overview:**
The Research Impact Team enhances the representation and impact of the university's research
endeavors and scholarly communication through its management of VERSO, the university's research
information management and Institutional Repository system, its promotion of university research, and
its efforts to facilitate connections between university researchers.
**Library KPIs:**
- Research Information Management
  - Profiles
  - Research Assets
  - Research Assets by Type
  - Research Output Downloads and Views
- Esploro KPI Dashboard
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Create clear policies and procedures for both public and internal users using VERSO and related
research data workflows
  - Why:
▪ To make it possible for all users to accomplish necessary tasks using up-to-
date information at time of need
  - How:
▪ Develop and disseminate comprehensive, public-facing documentation
to assist users in profile development and system utilization.
▪ Develop and disseminate comprehensive, public-facing policies to
educate users in proper system use and their rights/obligations.
▪ Develop and communicate comprehensive, intra-library documentation
to assist library users in profile development and system utilization.
▪ Develop and communicate comprehensive, intra-library policies to
educate staff in proper system use and user rights/obligations.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Published and up-to-date documentation for internal and public users is
available via a live website.
  - Fall update:
  - Live sites are available for public-facing procedures and policies, as well as internal
procedures. There is not yet a site for internal policies, simply a spreadsheet.
  - Of the preliminary 12 topics identified for internal procedures, 10 have some form of
documentation, covering most short-to-medium-term recurring tasks.

  - There are many open policy questions. The team decides them by drafting ½ - 1 page
policy proposals, discussing them in a quorum, voting on them, and recording the
results in minutes and our policies folder.
  - Currently, public-facing documentation relies a lot on existing Ex Libris tutorials (e.g.,
Adding Output to a Profile). We have not received sufficient feedback from users to
determine whether this is adequate or not.
  - Spring update:
  - The public facing procedures site has been updated. Previously, it included information
about editing profiles and assets. Now it also includes information about exporting
assets and controlling privacy. Links to Ex Libris’ generic Esploro documentation have
also been replaced with VERSO/U of I branded examples. Future topics, such as
adding/changing profile pictures, have been identified.
  - No additional internal procedures have been documented. Additional topics such as
minting DOI’s and markdown best practices have been identified.
  - Policy decisions continue to be made as needed and are recorded in the policies folder.
**Accepted policies include:**
▪ what counts as research which can be submitted to VERSO. Brief summary: FSH
5100 and 1320 jointly define what counts as research for the University. The RI
team policy states we follow the University definitions. Moreover, since VERSO’s
mission is to preserve and provide access to U of I research/creative output the
policy states it is appropriate for VERSO staff to act as stewards and reject non-
research submissions, while acknowledging the importance of subject-matter
expertise and the existence of grey areas.
▪ whether pre-prints ought to be included as research and allowed in VERSO. Brief
summary: yes, as long as they do not become the majority of the content within
VERSO. Pre-prints are an important form of scholarly communication and so
should be included. However, they are not considered authoritative versions of
record and so should not be VERSO’s main focus.
▪ maximum sizes for file submissions. Brief summary: VERSO deposits are limited
to 20GB or less. Larger submissions can have metadata records in VERSO but
must be hosted elsewhere. VERSO staff will assist with external hosting (e.g., by
coordinating with RCDS) if necessary. 20GB was chosen to balance the fact that
(1) VERSO currently has a 3TB storage limit which we don’t want to exceed, but
(2) there is demonstrated interest in using VERSO as a dataset repository and
replacement to RCDS’s DKAN repository; the lower the file size limit the less
helpful VERSO becomes for those users.
▪ preserving/archiving VERSO data. Brief summary: Every six months the RI team
will work with the Digital Lab Manager to ensure a copy of all researcher
metadata, research output metadata, and fulltext documents are stored in the
digital archives folders and linked to relevant special collections. This backs-up

important data, facilitates future re-use or analysis, and ensures the RI team
shares important collections info with SPEC.
Develop and improve institutional repository capabilities for library and internal partners
  - Why:
▪ To take advantage of system capabilities and serve campus needs
  - How:
▪ Build relationships with campus entities that can use our IR capabilities.
▪ Work with Extension to create means for using VERSO as possible
publication venue.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Successfully integrating significant collections and ongoing
collaborations with cross-campus entities, including Extension
▪ Clear policies and documentation developed and published for internal
and public users
  - Fall update:
  - All “active” extension publications in the Pacific Northwest Publication and Extension
Bulletin Series are in VERSO, totaling 287 and 246 outputs, respectively. We have
workflows for ingesting new active publications and are developing workflows to move
inactivated publications from VERSO to a digital collection.
  - We are also working with IIDS to archive as much of their data repository as possible.
We have the workflows to do that but need to make a policy decision on which datasets
are too large to store in VERSO and should instead link out. That collection totals 413
outputs.
  - We have also worked with the Mc Clure Center for Public Policy to ingest their
publications, newsletters, and reports, as well as set up workflows for further
submissions. This totals 130 ouputs.
  - We have automated ingestion of all theses and dissertations (2261 as of 5/19/2025).
  - We have not developed generalized policies and procedures for initiatives like the above
beyond instructing users to contact lib-verso@uidaho.edu. It’s not clear that we can
create generalized workflows at this time. We have not done enough of these
collaborations to anticipate or prescribe how they ought to go.
  - Spring update:
  - VERSO is now the preferred data repository for the U of I. All 413 datasets in IIDS’s
DKAN repository now have records in VERSO. All but the largest datasets have been
moved into VERSO. All future datasets will be represented in VERSO, and any 20GB or
smaller will be hosted in VERSO.
  - The team has worked with RCDS to develop the Collaboration Network, a site
that uses VERSO assets and researcher profiles to make U of I research and
researchers more discoverable. Collaboration Network uses LLMs to summarize
the content of researcher VERSO profiles, match them to a user’s natural

language queries, and serve up relevant researchers and research outputs from
VERSO. Closed beta testing of the Collaboration Network began in Nov 2024. The
RI team continues to work with IIDS in anticipation of a broader release
sometime during FY26.
  - The team is working to scrape the fulltext and metadata of open access UI publications
listed in Open Alex. It is too early for precise estimates, but preliminary data suggests
this could improve or ingest ~1k – 5k assets.
  - The team has also received enhanced metadata for ~8k VERSO assets which IIDS
scraped from Semantic Scholar for their Collab Net. We are working to parse the data,
load it into VERSO, and ensure the process is reversible if necessary.
Ensure Researcher Profiles and Asset presentation is up-to-date and accurate in VERSO
  - Why:
▪ To amplify the research and researchers at the University of Idaho
  - How:
▪ Develop and disseminate prototypes of a variety of possible research
**representing tools including:**
  - Subject or department specific collections
  - Analytics reports
  - visualizations
  - Success looks like:
▪ 95% of profiles accurately portray research of individuals.
▪ Ensure 100% profile coverage for all faculty members.
▪ Attain 85% profile coverage for non-faculty (research staff, post-docs)
researchers.
▪ 1 prototype of each research-representing tool disseminated to 1 or
more departments within each College.
  - Fall update:
▪ Based on information from the Provost’s office, we have profiles for all 770
current UI faculty, as well as an additional 87 miscellaneous profiles for 857
total. Of those, 10 (1.2%) still need biographic information corrected or added.
▪ It’s not clear how to determine whether profiles accurately portray the research
of individuals because there is no single master list. However, we can make
**some relative judgments:**
▪ Of the 857 profiles, 346 (40%) have fewer than 10 outputs. Depending
on the faculty member fewer than 10 may be acceptable but having
fewer outputs reduces the accuracy of VERSO’s automated publication
ingestion.
▪ Of the total 181 communications received from faculty and librarian
liaisons, 23 (13%) mentioned output/metadata issues.

▪ Of the 23,061 assets: 6568 (29%) have abstracts, 15142 (66%) have links
to access the output on the web or provide access to the file directly in
VERSO, and 5195 (23%) are tagged with either research topics or
keywords.
▪ VERSO is best at automatically ingesting STEM outputs. It is moderate
for social sciences and humanities but misses non-traditional scholarly
publications like sculptures or exhibitions completely. We worked to
solicit CV’s and input from humanities scholars but did not receive
enough feedback to create workflows for fixing this gap.
▪ It’s not clear how to determine the population of non-faculty researchers. The
87-non-faculty profiles in VERSO are certainly an underestimate.
▪ Several specialized collections have been developed. One for COGS, two for
CIIRE in EHHS (1, 2), and two for CALS extension (1, 2).
  - Spring update:
▪ The Fall update underestimated the number of profiles needing biographical
info corrections by leaving out researchers with missing education fields. As
such, despite the 10 researchers identified in the Fall being fixed, the Spring
analysis shows 14 of 882 (1.6%) profiles require additional bibliographic info.
▪ We continue to explore how to best measure whether 95% of profiles
accurately portray the research of individuals. The team reached out to a
statistical process control expert in Math/Stats to develop a method of sampling
profile accuracy by comparing profiles to CV’s. However, retrieving up-to-date
CV’s is a challenge. Manually comparing CV’s to VERSO profiles may also be too
labor intensive for the amount of metadata they contain, as well as being
redundant with an existing IIDS project to automatically extract data from CV’s.
Next year's charging document suggests an updated approach.
▪ We also continue to explore how to determine 85% coverage for non-faculty
researchers. The team has found and exported relevant data from People Admin
and Argos, but still needs to process it and work with individual Colleges to
verify we’re interpreting it correctly. Next year’s charging document suggests an
updated approach.
**Final Outcomes:**
The team has had three main directions: developing documentation, making policy decisions, and
improving the quality of VERSO data.
The main challenge for data improvements is difficulty finding comprehensive, accurate records of
researcher publications that we could use as benchmarks. This makes it difficult to assess whether “95%
of profiles accurately portray research of individuals” and whether we have attained “85% of profile
coverage for non-faculty".

Our main successes in this area are:
1. 100% profile coverage of all faculty with 98.4% correct biographical information.
2. Ongoing collaborations with CALS, CNR, COGS, and IIDS to ingest IR materials, totaling 3337 this
year.
The main challenge for developing documentation and policy is the lack of feedback from users. This
makes it difficult to decide which parts of VERSO are intuitive or require documentation, and which
policies are most relevant to users.
Nevertheless, our main successes in this area are:
1. establishing a baseline set of internal documentation explaining procedures for checking asset
metadata quality, researcher profile quality, and managing large chunks of VERSO data.
2. Creating public-facing documentation walking users through editing and adding content to their
profile, managing their privacy settings and when/how to contact the VERSO team,
3. developing and implementing a workflow for making policy decisions at times of need, and
4. performing outreach to campus by presenting to faculty senate, CALS and Co E departments,
holding office hours, and coordinating with liaisons to disseminate VERSO info and
documentation.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
The team’s work ingesting and curating bulk IR deposits has developed the Esploro/programming skills
needed for larger, more data-intensive improvements to VERSO. Based on COAR’s Good Practices for
IR’s, the team identified at least two ways to further improve VERSO’s data:
1. review existing VERSO assets to ensure as many as possible include or link out to the fulltext of
resources.
2. continue to identify and ingest IR materials, such as (1) OA U of I publications listed in Open Alex
but not VERSO, and (2) CDIL projects.
The COAR framework also recommends developing digital preservation plans, which dovetails
with the recently adopted preservation policy. As such, implementing and documenting policy
is another major priority for the upcoming year.
Again, it was a challenge to measure whether “95% of profiles accurately portray research of
individuals” and whether we have attained “85% of profile coverage for non-faculty" by compiling a

master list of researchers and research outputs. Next year the team will attempt to assess accuracy and
coverage by regularly and systematically soliciting user feedback on those issues.
Finally, the team may pursue other opportunities as we are able. These include:
1. Adding a default CC license to the VERSO asset depositor agreement and choosing a
license for reuse of VERSO’s metadata. This would improve our documentation by
providing more detailed info about what rights VERSO researchers retain.
2. Improving the discoverability of VERSO by connecting with third party metadata
discovery services like OAI-PMH, Open DOAR, and others.
3. Developing an OA dashboard summarizing amount and types of OA materials in VERSO.
This could be useful externally to communicate VERSO’s capabilities to stakeholders by
emphasizing the discoverability and access it provides. It could also be used internally to
collaborate with Open Strategies on assessing OA adoption across campus.
