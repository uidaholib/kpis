Access & Engagement Unit, Academic Year 2024-25
**Overview:**
The Access & Engagement Unit encompasses Access Services and Reference Services. Within
each of these areas, supporting our patrons and forming connections with them is crucial. In
Access Services in the Main Library and Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC), we seek to
“connect [in-person and virtual U of I affiliate and community members] to library resources,”
course reserves, spaces, and technology.1 In Reference Services, we seek to “assist, advise, and
instruct [in-person and virtual U of I affiliates and community members]” in finding, accessing, and
evaluating information related to their information and research needs.2 The work of this unit
occurs synchronously and asynchronously.
**Library KPIs:**
- Primary Responsibility
  - Building Usage
  - Course Reserves
  - Research and Reference Assistance
- Relevant
  - Online Catalog
  - Physical Circulation
  - Student Savings

AY 2025 – 2026 Objectives Document: Access-and-Engagement_Objectives KPIs_AY25-26.docx
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Facilitate physical and electronic Course Reserves
- Why:
  - Save students money and increase access to required and recommended course
materials
- How:
  - Support faculty and instructors in their use of Course Reserves

  - Ensure that website information is kept up-to-date
  - Collaborate with the Open Strategies Team to advertise Course Reserves services
  - Seek feedback from the campus community
- Success looks like:
  - Continued or increased usage of Course Reserves by faculty and instructors
  - Positive interactions with faculty and instructors
  - Continued cost-savings for students
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - 89 instructors (excluding those teaching ENGL 101/102 and MATH 170/175/275)
across 103 courses and 40 subjects utilized Course Reserves for required and/or
recommended readings in fall 2024. These courses served approximately 6,969
enrolled students and in total, physical course reserves circulated 107 times,
Controlled Digital Lending items were viewed 4,646 times, and four additional
ebook licenses were purchased based on turnaway notifications. We estimate that
Course Reserves saved enrolled students over $474,000 on the purchase of
required and recommended physical items across all courses utilizing this service.
Cost-savings by discipline ranged from $718.40 across all Biological Engineering
courses to $83,109.90 across all English courses, with the average cost-savings by
discipline equaling $11,871.56. These data are affected by the number of courses
utilizing course reserves, within each discipline, and the number of students
enrolled in these courses. Estimated cost-savings of items on Course Reserves, by
all discipline is available in Sheet 2 of the Fall 2024 metrics spreadsheet. This is the
first year that we’ve gathered data on all courses using Course Reserves, instead of
just courses who utilize this service for required readings. As such, a comparison
between fall 2024 and AY 2023 – 2024 data is not feasible. However, current usage
of Course Reserves by instructors as well as the number of circulations and views
of items on Course Reserves appears to indicate that the Library is filling a need on
campus. Data gathered for future reports will allow us to more clearly identify if
usage continues or increases over time.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - 76 instructors (excluding those teaching ENGL 101/102 and MATH 170/175/275)
across 91 courses and 41 subjects utilized Course Reserves for required and/or
recommended readings in spring 2025; these courses served approximately 5,396
enrolled students.
  - In total, physical course reserves circulated 253 times, Controlled Digital Lending
items were viewed 3,653 times, and two additional ebook licenses were purchased
based on turnaway notifications.
  - We estimate that Course Reserves saved enrolled students over $417,000 on the
purchase of required and recommended physical items across all courses utilizing
this service.
  - Cost-savings by discipline were the largest for History courses and smallest for
Curriculum & Instruction courses. These data are affected by the number of
courses utilizing Course Reserves, the number of items on reserve for each course,
and the number of students enrolled in these courses.

  - The estimated cost-savings of items on Course Reserves, across all disciplines, are
available in Sheet 2 of the Spring 2025 metrics spreadsheet.
  - Current usage of Course Reserves by instructors as well as the number of
circulations and views of items on Course Reserves appears to indicate that the
Library is filling a need on campus.
- Final outcomes
  - Over the last year, Course Reserves were utilized by instructors across more than
40 subjects. Physical items were checked out 360 times and Controlled Digital
Lending items were viewed more than 8,200 times. These data appear to indicate
that the Library is filling a need on campus.
  - The cost-savings metric we use for physical items demonstrates that Course
Reserves saves students across campus a combined total of more than $400,000
per semester. Savings appear to be largest for students enrolled in English and
History courses and smallest for students enrolled in Biological Engineering and
Curriculum & Instruction courses. However, these cost-savings data are not perfect
and vary based on the number of courses utilizing Course Reserves, the number of
items on reserve for each course, the number of students enrolled in these courses,
and the accuracy of the average book cost used.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - Moving forward, it would be useful to investigate whether other cost-saving metrics
could provide a more accurate picture of the impact of Course Reserves on student
costs. Right now, we are using an average book cost to determine cost-savings, but
in the future, it could be worth exploring whether we could use actual book costs
(as shared on the bookstore’s website or Amazon) for each course to determine
cost-savings. This would require much more time on the part of staff to gather these
data and calculate the cost-savings, but it might lead to more accurate data.
  - There might also be an opportunity to partner more closely with liaisons, who can
contact faculty of courses with high enrollment prior to the semester and offer to
purchase required texts for Course Reserves.
  - One ongoing challenge is gathering qualitative feedback from instructors and
students on Course Reserves. Starting in Fall 2025, the Library will conduct focus
group with students across campus and we hope that these conversations will
result in data that can inform our services.
Review and maintain physical collection stacks
- Why:
  - Save patron time
  - Increase usability of physical collection stacks
  - Reduce patron confusion
- How:
  - Shelve returned and new items in a timely manner
  - Conduct ongoing review of physical collection stacks for accuracy, damage,
cleanliness, and order
- Sucess looks like:

  - Reduction in un-loaned items labelled as missing
  - Orderly and accurate physical collection stacks
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Main Library Access Services continued their review of physical collection stacks,
reviewing the A-G call number ranges. During their review, they identified more than
500 missing/lost items, 20 mis-shelved items, 8 items with call number issues, and
134 items not in Alma. Throughout the course of the semester, they pulled 296
items for mending and 602 duplicate items for review by subject librarians. They
also identified 686 un-loaned items as missing. This time-consuming collection
maintenance work ensures that patrons are able to find what they need when they
visit our stacks. In Fall 2024, the Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC) added 696
items to their collection and removed/deleted 819 items. Again, this work ensures
that our collections are usable and relevant for our patrons.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Main Library Access Services continued their review of physical collection stacks,
reviewing the E-F call number ranges.
▪ During their review, they identified more than 1,200 missing/lost items, 19
mis-shelved items, 28 items with call number issues, and 53 items not in
Alma.
▪ Throughout the course of the semester, they pulled 878 items for mending
and mended 332 items
▪ 665 duplicate items or multiple editions were also pulled for review by
subject librarians.
  - The Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC) added 1,214 items to their collection
and removed/deleted 333 items.
- Final outcomes
  - Reviewing and maintaining the Main Library’s and GSCC’s physical stacks is a time-
consuming, but beneficial task that ensures that our collections are usable and
accessible for our patrons.
  - The comparison between Alma and the Main Library’s physical stacks has resulted
in the identification of more than 1,700 missing/lost items, 39 mis-shelved items, 36
items with call number issues, and 187 items not in Alma.
  - Over the course of the year, more than 600 items were mended, and more than
1,200 duplicates/multiple editions were pulled for review by subject librarians.
  - This was also a busy year for the GSCC, with the addition of more than 1,900 new
items. This year’s curriculum adoption was English Language Arts.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - The project workflow for comparing Alma and the Main Library’s physical stacks will
shift slightly based on discussions between the Access Services Manager, Unit
Head for Access & Engagement, and the Associate Dean of Operations & Access
once the fourth floor is complete.
▪ Continue the comparison between Alma and the stacks
- Identifying mis-shelved items, missing items, etc.
▪ Reduce mending criteria

- Only pull those items that are falling apart, moldy, or needing a new
label
▪ Reach out to liaisons once to ask about duplicates/multiple editions
- Ask if they want a list to review for any of their call number areas, or
if they want to keep/remove all duplicates and older editions,
keeping the most recent
Provide relevant and timely point-of-need Reference and Circulation services
- Why:
  - Ensure that Access & Engagement service points reflect the current needs of
patrons
- How:
  - Track and analyze point-of-need service point interactions
  - Track and analyze data on hold requests
  - Seek feedback from the campus community
- Success looks like:
  - Positive interactions with patrons
  - Monitoring usage of point-of-need Reference and Circulation services and making
recommendations based on data
  - Completing IDOC resident students’ ‘Requests For More Sources’ within one week
of receipt
  - Filling hold requests for physical items (held by U of I Library) in timely manner
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Reference, Main Library Access Services, and GSCC employees staffed their
service points at various hours throughout the semester. In Fall 2024, Reference
received 1,691 questions (a 2.2% increase when compared to Fall 2023) and the
GSCC received 380 questions (a 55% increase when compared to Fall 2023). In Fall
2024, 68% of reference questions were classified as READ level 2 or higher, while
only 54% were classified similarly in Fall 2023. Main Library Access Services
continued to utilize Lib Answers to track questions and began a basic desk count in
late October, reporting more than 2,000 interactions with patrons. These data are
currently being used to inform schedules and service models, with both Reference
and the GSCC considering changes to their hours in future semesters. In fall 2024,
the Reference Coordinator, Access Services Manager, and Unit Head also began
discussing cross-training Access Services students on known-item reference
assistance. So far, we’ve surveyed students about their knowledge and experience
answering reference questions and met to discuss our goals for training. An initial
training is planned for February 2025 and will include Main Library and GSCC
Access Services student employees, with the goal of holding smaller/shorter check-
in trainings in the future. Four IDOC requests were received in fall 2024, with
librarians completing these requests within 2.5 days, on average, and the entire
request being completed within 9 days. Hold requests for physical items were filled
at a consistently fast rate, with the time between request submission and
placement on the hold shelf averaging 30.9 hours, or 1.2 days (this data is available

in Alma Analytics/Shared Folders/University of Idaho/Reports/Access and
Engagement/Average Time-Holds Processed).
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Reference received 1,074 questions (a 21% decrease when compared to Spring
2024).
▪ 68% of reference questions were classified as READ level 2 or higher, while
only 63% were classified similarly in Spring 2024.
▪ When looking at questions by format and READ Level, 89.6% of IM questions
were rated as READ Level 2 or above, compared to 52.8% of in-person
questions.
- In Spring 2024, 81.9% of IM questions were rated as READ Level 2 or
above, compared to 48% of in-person questions.
  - The GSCC received 278 questions (a 17% increase when compared to Spring 2024).
  - Main Library Access Services continued to utilize Lib Answers and a basic desk
count to track questions, reporting more than 3,601 interactions with patrons.
  - The Reference Coordinator provided a cross-training session for Access Services
students on known-item reference assistance. Unfortunately, only a small number
of students were able to attend.
  - Reference support of IDOC requests for more sources ended in Spring 2025 as the
Idaho Department of Correction was able to participate in the JSTOR Access in
Prison Initiative.
- Final outcomes
  - In AY 2024 – 2025, reference received 2,765 questions, an 8.5% decrease when
compared to AY 2023 – 2024.
▪ READ Level 2 questions and higher increased by 7.9% in AY 2024 – 2025
when compared to the previous academic year.
▪ Most questions in AY 2024 – 2025 came from U of I affiliates (89%) and more
than half of all questions were asked in-person (57.6%). These statistics are
on par with what was reported in AY 2023 – 2024.
▪ When looking at questions by format and READ Level, 91.7% of IM questions
were rated as READ Level 2 or above, compared to 53.7% of in-person
questions. In comparison, in AY 2023 – 2024, 73.7% of IM questions were
rated as READ Level 2 or above, compared to 44.9% of in-person questions
  - The GSCC received 658 questions, a 39% increase in questions when compared to
AY 2023 – 2024.
▪ A plurality of questions in AY 2024 – 2025 were related to book requests
(24.3%), most questions came from students (65.3%), and almost all
questions were asked in-person (93%).
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - Errors in the Alma Analytics report created to track timing for fulfilling hold requests
and the inability to separate out Summit requests meant that the data associated
with this metric were inaccurate in Fall 2024 and could not be reported in Spring
2025. Looking ahead, more time will need to be spent within Analytics to see if this

data can be generated. If not, it will be necessary to identity other metrics to track
the rate of filling hold requests for physical items (held by U of I Library).
  - Starting in Fall 2025, we plan to schedule shorter, check-in trainings with Access
Services students throughout the semester.
Provide timely access to the Main Library and Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC)
- Why:
  - Ensure that Main Library and GSCC building hours reflect the current needs of
patrons
- How:
  - Gather and analyze gate count data
  - Analyze space usage gathered by other Units/Teams
  - Seek feedback from the campus community
- Success looks like:
  - Continued or increased usage of the Main Library and GSCC during open hours
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Between August 2024 and December 2024, the Main Library gate count reported
more than 122,527 visitors, a 7% decrease when compared to Fall 2023. However,
these numbers are lower than expected as the gate counter malfunctioned and
stopped counting at various times throughout the semester. Even with these issues,
data do indicate an 11% increase in footfalls in October 2024 when compared to
October 2023. The GSCC also had consistently high usage with a total of 924
visitors, with 365 footfalls in September 2024 alone. Space tracking undertaken by
Main Library Access Services also indicates consistently high usage of the Library’s
open and reservable spaces. Data collection last year was inconsistent so a
comparison is not feasible, but data from Fall 2024 indicate that first-floor open
spaces averaged more than 4,000 users per month, with October being the busiest
month. The open and reservable group study rooms on the first, third, and fourth
floors averaged 105 users per month, while the reservable individual study rooms
averaged 34 users per month. Although a few study carrels were used frequently,
overall, these spaces showed limited use, with occupants identified as using these
spaces only approximately 7 times per month, on average.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Between January 2025 and May 2025, the Main Library gate count reported
approximately 129,316 visitors, a 22% increase in footfalls when compared to
Spring 2024.
▪ The open spaces on the first floor were the most used area in the Main
Library and the first-floor reservable group study rooms had the most usage,
on average, when compared to other reservable and open study rooms.
▪ Usage of the Data Hub space increased 85% between Fall 2024 and Spring
2025.
  - Space tracking undertaken by Main Library Access Services also indicates
consistently high usage of the Library’s open and reservable spaces.

▪ Data indicate that first-floor open spaces averaged more than 3,400 users
per month, with February being the busiest month.
▪ The open and reservable group study rooms on the first, third, and fourth
floors averaged 82 users per month, while the reservable individual study
rooms averaged 27 users per month.
▪ Space tracking identified users in all 12 study carrels at least once during
the semester. Overall, these spaces showed limited use when compared to
the two reservable individual study rooms, with occupants identified as
using these spaces approximately 4 times per month, on average.
  - The GSCC reported fewer visitors in Spring 2025 (670 visitors) than in Fall 2024, with
January and April being their busiest months.
- Final outcomes
  - In AY 2024 – 2025, the Main Library gate count reported approximately 251,843
visitors, a 3% decrease when compared to AY 2023 – 2024. We did experience gate
counter malfunctions in Fall 2024 and consider this decrease minor.
  - Space tracking undertaken by Main Library Access services indicates that the open
spaces on the first floor were the most used area in the Main Library.
▪ The first-floor reservable group study rooms had the most usage, on
average, when compared to other reservable and open study rooms.
▪ Usage of the Data Hub space increased approximately 84% between Fall
2024 and Spring 2025.
▪ On average, carrel usage was low when compared to the usage of the two
reservable individual study rooms.
  - The GSCC’s tracking sheet indicates 1,594 visitors during AY 2024 – 2025, with a
total of 12 class visits.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - After collecting space tracking data for an entire academic year and being more
diligent in confirming that the gate counter is functional, we can begin the process
of examining the Main Library’s open hours to determine if they still meet the needs
of our campus community as well as considering whether we need more student
employees at specific times of time of the day. We might also be able to leverage
the upcoming focus groups to gauge the times when students use or want to use
the Library.
▪ Based on the space tracking data, we also have the information necessary
to justify transitioning additional carrells to reservable individual study
rooms.
  - Across the Main Library and GSCC, we can potentially use gate count and space
tracking data to inform when we want to host Library events.
  - Consistency in completing space tracking in the Main Library improved in Spring
2025, but gaps in data collection remain. As we move into the next academic year,
we will need to ensure that student employees remain diligent in this work and that
gaps are minimized.
Timebound: Investigate new reference model options

- Why:
  - Ensure that the reference model used meet the needs of patrons based on point-of-
need interaction data
- How:
  - Review reference models at other academic libraries
  - Review point-of-need reference interactions
  - Discuss model options with Reference group and Library leadership
- Success looks like:
  - By the end of the year, develop a list of reference model options, with pros and cons
for each option, and a recommendation for AY 2025 – 2026
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Reference librarians generated a list of three reference models with pros and cons
for each option. These were shared with the Dean of Libraries and Associate Dean
of Operations and Access.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Following additional conversations with the Dean of Libraries and Associate Dean
of Operations and Access as well as meetings with the Reference group, Reference
Services will pursue a pilot project for AY 2025 – 2026.
▪ This will include moving the Reference Desk to the second floor, having two
librarians staff a larger portion of open hours, and inviting colleagues
outside Access & Engagement to staff the desk.
- Final outcomes
  - Reference Services spent the year exploring the philosophical and practical
implications of changes to our reference model.
  - We believe that shifting to a model where two librarians staff a larger portion of
open hours, rather than equally dividing hours amongst the Reference group,
ensures that we maintain a high level of service, while also ensuring that librarians
have sufficient time to step away from the desk and engage in other aspects of their
jobs.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - Moving to a new location on the second floor could create space for more in-depth
reference questions and allow for greater opportunities to collaborate with the
Writing Center and Tutoring Services.
  - There are concerns about whether patrons referred from the Circulation Desk to the
Reference Desk will follow through. There are also concerns about whether
returning patrons will notice our empty space at the first-floor desk, miss the new
directional signage, and assume that the Reference Desk is closed, rather than
located elsewhere.
