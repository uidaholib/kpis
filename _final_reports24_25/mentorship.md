**MENTORSHIP/SCHOLARSHIP TEAM**
**Overview:**
The Mentorship/Scholarship Team enhances faculty development through the creation of formal and
informal mentorship opportunities and fostering a supportive academic community via co-working and
professional development opportunities.
**Library KPIs:**
- Library Faculty Scholarship (Primary)
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Create cohort communication venues and mentorship possibilities for new librarians
- Why: Create cohesion and inclusion for new librarians
- How: Monthly/bi-Monthly meeting of new librarians, facilitated by team member
Conversations and inquiries to new librarians over the year regarding their need for
collaboration or mentorship
- Success looks like: Documented mentorship and collaboration occurring among new librarians
and between new librarians and those further along in their career.
- Fall update: We organized two virtual gatherings for the seven newest members of our faculty
(Tyler, Andrew, Norm, Rebecca, Kelley, Pam, and Leesa) to learn about important aspects of
Library culture and processes, as well as facilitate open conversations. The first meeting was
essentially a check-in to see how folks were doing in their first several months and solicit
feedback on the topics they’d like covered in future meetings. The second meeting covered
preparing for annual reviews, formatting CVs, and general productivity hacks. In the spring there
are one or two more meetings planned, at least one of which will be dedicated to the lifecycle of
a scholarly publication.
- Spring update: We organized one virtual gathering of the seven newest faculty members in
January, during which time Jylisa Kenyon gave an overview of the scholarly publication lifecycle
and then answered questions from attendees. We organized one in-person gathering in May to
cover topics including university hierarchy, communicating across campus, and scheduling and
leading meetings. That was facilitated by Dean Ben Hunter, Devin Becker, and Dulce Kersting-
Lark. A social hour followed the meeting, which offered a nice opportunity for the new
colleagues to reflect on the academic year.
Facilitate formal and informal collaboration opportunities for faculty
- Why: Support faculty librarian scholarship and improve library culture
- How: Facilitate First Friday scholarship sessions and invite all faculty. Facilitate one sprint-like
activity over a span of time that allows faculty to devote specific time for advancing scholarship
activities.
- Success looks like: Activities and sessions have been offered.

- Fall update: Over the fall semester the team organized three “Friday Faculty Meet-ups.” The
location of each meet-up changed – at IRIC, in Brink Hall, and at One World Cafe. Attendance
ranged from 4 to 8 attendees over the course of the semester. In addition to the meet-ups, the
team felt that more intentional celebration of our colleagues’ successes would benefit our
overall culture of scholarship. We developed a form to better track the proposals and
publications of significant work by librarians.
- Spring update: Four “Friday Faculty Meet-ups" were offered in the spring semester, held
alternately at One World Cafe and in IIRC. Attendance held steady at between 4 and 8. The
“Faculty Scholarship Wins” form was used throughout the semester. Since it launched in
November, it has been used 19 times. During the two spring faculty meetings, the most recent
submissions to the form were shared with the assembled group as a way to celebrate the
success of our colleagues.
Final Outcomes: The team had a successful year and met the majority of its goals. Although it did not
hold a sprint as originally planned, it did pursue meaningful ways to support junior colleagues and
encourage scholarly productivity across the faculty. The New/er Faculty Cohort was a useful vehicle for
mentoring the large number of recently hired librarians. The outlines from each of the four gatherings
held over the year can be used as a template moving forward for mentoring additional new colleagues,
even if it is in a one-one setting rather than a seven-person cohort.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year: In the next two to three years there will be many librarians
going through their 3rd year review and/or going up for tenure. The Mentorship-Scholarship Team
should be on the lookout for ways to support those colleagues. One option would be to offer “office
hours” with Associate Dean Devin Becker who could review CVs or scholarship plans with faculty who
would like additional guidance. We anticipate at least one new librarian will be joining the faculty in the
coming months, so the team will plan a handful of meetings with that new colleague to go over the
basics that the cohort covered this year. Finally, the scholarly landscape continues to change in both
large and small ways. The sudden termination of relevant grants this year needs to be discussed as a
faculty, as does the evolution of open access publication. Some brown-bag type meetings could be
organized during the academic year to bring about those conversations.
