**LIAISONS TEAM 2024-2025**
**Overview:**
The Liaison team enriches formal and informal learning opportunities and advances the
research, scholarly, and creative activity of faculty and students by broadly communicating
library offerings, services, and capacities, building individual and institutional relationships with
faculty in the various colleges, and providing discipline specific instruction and assistance for
students and faculty.
**Library KPIs:**
- Course Reserves
- Electronic Resources
- Geographic Information Systems
- Physical Circulation
- Research Information Management
- Instruction
- Research and Reference Assistance
- Workshops and Presentations
**Meeting Minutes:**
- Meeting Agenda 2024-2025.docx
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Library liaisons will engage in significant interactions and collaborations (as recorded on the
interactions form) with faculty and students from across the University
- Why:
  - To build connections across campus and advance the educational and research
missions of the university
- How:
  - Support university faculty and students in Liaison areas through research
assistance, instruction support, and project collaboration
- Success looks like:
  - Liaisons and faculty will, by year’s end, have had at least one significant
interaction with students and/or faculty from every department on campus.
- Fall Update:

  - Currently we have not come close to meeting this goal. We have not interacted
with 15 departments, including (by college):
▪ College of Art and Architecture
- architecture
- interior architecture and design
- landscape architecture
- virtual technology and design
▪ College of Agricultural and Life Sciences
- agricultural economics and rural sociology
- agricultural education, leadership, and communications
- margaret ritchie school of family and consumer sciences
▪ College of Business and Economics
- accounting and mis
▪ College of Education, Health and Human Sciences
- leadership and counseling
- movement sciences
▪ College of Engineering
▪ College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences
- lionel hampton school of music
- school of global studies
▪ College of Natural Resources
- natural resources and society
- fish and wildlife sciences
▪ College of Science
- Chemistry
- Spring Update:
  - Due to lack of interest and complexity of tracking, we decided to move on from
this goal.
Individual Library liaisons will share information about their liaison areas and practices with
the rest of the team
- Why:
  - Improve library faculty knowledge of university colleges and initiatives
  - Share practices and experiences to help other liaisons improve their work
- How:

  - Each Liaison will present to the team an overview of their college, colleges, or
area (GIS/SPEC) and their liaison activities therein.
- Success looks like:
  - Each liaison will present at least once during the year to the rest of the team
- Fall Update:
  - So far, four Liaisons have presented to the group on their respective areas and
colleges. These have covered CNR, CBE, CLASS (Social Sciences), and CDIL.
  - Presentations have led to fruitful discussions and suggestions for improved
service.
- Spring Update:
  - All Liaisons presented on their areas and/or specialties this year. We all found
these really illuminating, and the presentations led to some excellent
conversations and recommendations. I hope that having this grounding in each
others areas and practice will help this team move forward more collaboratively
and individuals do their jobs more effectively.
The Liaison Team will serve as a feedback mechanism for other library teams and for those
working on library initiatives
- Why:
  - Liaisons possess unique knowledge and experience of the university that can be
leveraged for advice and insight into possible library actions and projects.
- How:
  - The team will be available as a feedback mechanism for any other team or
faculty initiative via regular meetings and will advertise this function to the larger
library.
- Success looks like:
  - The team will provide feedback for several library programs/teams/initiatives
throughout the year
- Fall Update:
  - We have not received any requests for feedback yet. We also have not really
advertised our services in this regard ... For the spring, we will make sure folks
know this is an option.
- Spring Update:
  - We gave a small amount of feedback to the Collections team, but otherwise
didn’t do much in this area.

**Final Outcomes**
This was our first year operating as a mostly informational/social group, and I think reconfiguring
the group this way was a good start. Our main project was having everyone present on their
area. The presentations were really excellent overall, with individuals going into detail about
their networking, instruction, and collecting processes. The presentations about the liaisons’
colleges gave particularly good insights, and often led to discussions and recommendations
about/for individuals’ practice.
While feedback wasn’t specifically sought by any but the collections group this year, we did end
up considering the literacies project presented by the library as well. And while this part of the
objectives wasn’t really fulfilled, I believe establishing this baseline of shared practice will be
fruitful overall in this area, especially for the newer liaisons, as we look to invite more direct
collaboration going forward (see below).
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year

For next year, we intend to invite representatives from other teams to present for each meeting.
We’re thinking specifically we would like to hear from and converse with the following teams:
- Collections team
- Instructions team
- Research Impact team
- Open Engagement
- Wider University/Library Admin Update
And we’ll look to structure these conversations towards similar goals for this year –
information sharing and improving our practices.
Otherwise, this group looks forward to updating each other and conversing again next year.
Overall, this is a strong group of faculty doing excellent and important work for the library,
and we’d like to maintain our connections and expand our reach. As I work on the goals for
next year, I also look forward to finding some means toward collaborative work, perhaps
related to work with the Instruction Team and the ongoing literacies project, as I feel like
the intersection of those teams is a good spot for that work to be accomplished.
