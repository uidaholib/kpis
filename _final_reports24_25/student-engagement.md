Student Engagement, Academic Year 2024-25
Last updated 6/11/25
**Overview:**
The Student Engagement Team provides opportunities for students to engage with and learn more
about library staff, resources, campus services, and each other. The team strives to create a sense of
community in which all levels of students feel seen, heard, and comfortable engaging with the library.
They offer in-person events and asynchronous connections by creating non-curricular programming or
by collaborating with others in the campus community who do the same.
**Relevant Library Metrics:**
- Building Usage
- Exhibits
**Objectives:**
- Objective #1:
  - Maximize student awareness of and comfort in library spaces, resources, services,
and staff.
  - Why:
▪ To educate students about services and resources that may benefit their
research, educational, and personal information needs.
▪ To ease anxiety students may have about library resources, staff, or spaces.
▪ Give students opportunities to interact with the library in a both synchronous
and asynchronous way that builds community.
  - How:
▪ Design, market, offer, or participate in engaging non-curricular events that
provide students with an opportunity to learn about library resources, services,
and staff
▪ Identify and collaborate with partners outside of the library to coordinate
similar events.
▪ Create and assessment plan rubric for events and growth
▪ Sketch out key Library events we’d like to do annually and create reoccurring
schedule
  - Success looks like:
▪ Student awareness of library resources, services, and staff members.
▪ Student participation and engagement in events and programs.
▪ Identification and prioritization of key events.
  - Fall Update
▪ 16 successful events were held (up from 12 last fall) with 938 students being
reached (up from 454 last fall, a 206% increase!)
▪ Our whiteboard also saw and uptick in participation
- Our average engagement this fall was 81% as compared to 79% last fall
  - Spring Update
▪ 12 successful events were held with 568 students

- down from 17 last spring, we decided to not attend the Earth Jamm
celebration since the MILL already represented the library. We also had
fewer book club meetings as last spring we did two groups for both
books.
▪ Our whiteboard saw a slight decrease to 79% coverage on average.
- We saw less interaction with the first and last question of the semester
than we did in the fall
▪ Final outcomes
- We see a slight reduction in our engagement opportunities over the
course of this academic year in large part due to some changes made to
our Hit the Book(s) club program and decisions about the efficiency of
outreach opportunities. In the past the library has been represented at
many events by two tables, the general library table and the M.I.L.L. This
year at Earth Jamm it was decided for just the M.I.L.L to attend as the
main attraction. We also had a decrease in other campus events that
were centered around more DEI initiatives that we no longer held. In the
Fall Hit the Book(s) ran two separate meeting times and sessions for
each book whereas in the Spring that only occurred for one book,
making a marked reduction in event metrics there. The very slight
decreases in the engagement with the whiteboard could be just due to
Spring semester fatigue but is something to monitor as we formalize
tracking this metric.
▪ Challenges and opportunities
- Next semester there is already a planned increase in activity due to the
addition of a graduate student book club. Tyler is also setting up
meetings with student housing to reestablish a partnership there for
event opportunities. The team has discussed some potential event
opportunities and plans to implement them in the next coming year as
an aspirational goal.
- Challenges that remain are staffing of tabling events and how to better
leverage student ambassadors. Perhaps the team will try and develop a
more formal path to “booking” student employees as resources.
- Objective #2:
  - Maximize the awareness and use of key or unique library collections.
  - Why:
▪ To highlight library collections that are diverse and engaging and that may not
otherwise be heavily used.
  - How:
▪ Create library displays or work with campus partners to do so.
▪ Include materials from the library’s collection for display.
▪ Cultivate library cubbies genre collection.
▪ Get Board game collection up to current processing standards

  - Success looks like:
▪ Rotating displays in both the Library and GSCC that highlight different print
collections.
▪ Increased circulation of materials via displays.
▪ Rotating participatory displays that let students engage creatively and
constructively with each other.
▪ Utilization of collections from cubbies.
▪ Utilization use of board games collections.
  - Fall Update
▪ We’ve had 5 library partner displays so far; this is a slight decrease from last
year’s 7 partnerships.
- This could be due to the changing nature of offices and programs across
the campus this semester.
- As well as our implementation of a permanent display partnership with
the Frist Generation Student Center.
▪ The big win here comes from our materials checked out from displays, we had
256 checkouts this fall as compared to the 37 from 2023 (a 691% increase!)
- This success comes mainly from implementing out new genre focused
cubby displays.
- We might consider in the future what other more “fun” targeted
shelving we could employ in the library.
▪ Our board game circulation starts for this semester are 248 as compared to 184
last fall (134% increase).
**▪ Metrics:**
- The hit the books website received 821 hits last fall, compared to 822
last fall.
- 155 hits on the common read guide
- 40 qr code hits from the bookmark
- 260 From board game collection builder
  - Spring Update
▪ We’ve had 4 library partner displays which holds steady with last spring.
- Materials that were curated for displays received 9 check outs.
▪ Our Genre cubbies received 106 checkouts
- Down from the first full semester which could be a typical pattern but
this collection is overdue for a refresh and wedding which will occur this
summer as we migrate in the browsing collection.
▪ Our board game circulation received 121 check outs
- This collection is also over-due for an update in organizing and new
materials.
- In April Abby was trained to assist in updating this collection but so far
no work has been completed.
▪ For our marketing materials we saw
- 48 QR code hits from our library bookmark
- 599 hits on the book club libguide
- 569 hits on the common read libguide
- 426 hits on the board game collection builder site

▪ Final outcomes
- We saw a slight increase in interaction with the bookmark even with the
decrease in engagement opportunities which might indicate our fewer
events are still effective. The large growth comes in engagement with
the common read libguide and this is most likely due to the library
strengthening its relationship with the common read program and the
Director of General Education. We also saw a healthy growth in views of
the board game collection site; this could be due in part to the release of
an article on this tool in March. Check outs from both the board games
and genre cubbies fell between fall and spring, this is mostly likely due to
both collections being past due for a refresh. We have dissolved the
browsing collection and merged that with the genre cubbies, which
could lead to an increase next AY.
▪ Challanges and Opportunities
- This biggest challenge here is the lack of time and manpower to make
updates and changes for the board game collection. This summer we
hope to get some work done in this area and are hopeful that with the
addition of Abby the board game collection may get some much-needed
help. There is also an opportunity to refresh some of our flyer marketing
materials as well as seek out new engagement partners.
- Objective #3:
  - Ensure that engagement programing follows national trends and best
practices as well as aligns with the library’s mission and goals.
- Why:
  - To help identify specific opportunities that will maximize student engagement
without overburdening library staff.
- How:
  - Conduct and compile a literature review on the areas of student engagement
we are currently involved in to formalize our work.
  - Develop a mechanism for assessment of our programing and timeline for
assessment to occur.
- Fall Update
  - We have not made any progress towards this goal as we have focused on the
other areas of development in the last few semesters.
- The hope is to analyze the 12 articles that have been collected for
growth and develop a program for assessment summer 25
- We have presented on our programs and been accepted for publication
on our board game collection but there is still a necessity for assessment
and growth plan to be created.
- Spring update
  - A literature review focused on book clubs in academic libraries is currently being
conducted by Tyler in preparation for an ACRL book focused on this area of service
  - Tyler went to ACRL in April and participated in 3 round tables focused on book clubs

- A meeting of 7 other librarians across the nation was held to inform them on
how the university of Idaho book club started and is run
- An Editor from C&RL reached out to Tyler to solicit an article on this work as
well
- Final outcomes
  - This academic year a lot of time and effort has been spent on changes to event
planning and engagement, as well as our main workforce being pulled into other
projects which has not allowed for much assessment past basic student head counts
and observational data. We have since had a large increase in scholarship
opportunities that we hope to capitalize on in the next few years.
- Challenges and opportunities
  - Since this work is tied mainly to one individual that is the only tenure track
faculty member on the team, it might be considered to remove this objective from
the team document. While there is progress and opportunities for this work and
growth in this area, it remains a difficult metric to assess in this formalized way.
