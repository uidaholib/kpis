OPEN STRATEGIES TEAM Academic Year 2024-2025
Created May 23, 2025
Finalized June 5th, 2025
**Overview:**
The Open Strategies Team supports student success and the transformation of scholarly communication
by building understanding, engagement, and capacity for open access, open education, and open
scholarship practices both in the Library and throughout the university.
**Library KPIs:**
- Course Reserves required course materials
  - Estimated total savings for students for AY 24-25 is $174,437, across 64 courses and
reaching 1,927 students.
From OST KPI’s
- Student Savings (Primary)
  - Amount saved via Think Open program:
▪ This year we did not have any new Think Open Fellowships.
▪ Program savings to date is estimated to be: $877,892
  - Amount saved via Reserves
▪ $174,437 is the 24-25 year estimate for savings for required course materials
offered in course reserves
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
1) Make University of Idaho students' education more affordable
  - Why:
▪ To save students money and Increase access to materials for students and overall
affordability of education at the university
  - How:
▪ Support and promote the use of open educational resources, open textbooks, open
pedagogy practices, and other strategies
▪ Create a workshop Mini-Series on Open on Campus, 3 to 4 short video workshops to get
folks up to speed
▪ Focus course marking communications to staff and faculty vs messaging to students
▪ Increase low and zero-cost courses offered on campus
  - Success looks like:

▪ Save students at least $100,000 through open practices
**Fall Updates:**
  - Links to the Open at U of I pressbook and course marking tool were added to the Course
Marking page in lieu of creating a video for finding these tools
  - Discussions were had re: marketing/communicating course marking initiative:
  - Having a representative at the bookstore during textbook adoption time to discuss
course marking (inclusive access has a representative)
  - Presenting on course marking at faculty orientation
  - Involving academic advisors
**Spring Updates:**
  - Planning an OA week for October 2025 to help build faculty awareness around Open
  - Planning and deciding a communication format to share Open opportunities both
hosted by the library and elsewise (likely a blog with an email list blast to previous
Think Open fellows and other Open interested folks)
  - Key findings from the 2023 survey show:
  - Students report needing only modest price reductions ($11) to make classes
materials feel mor affordable
  - Around half are skipping a required text
  - 18% report not having a choice in what classes they pick
  - The most expensive colleges are SBE and SAA, however the SAA students
report a bigger affordability gap (SBE students actually report they can afford
their materials). EHHS also has a notable affordability gap. Work with Liaisons
to share what their college findings are.
2) Leverage Verso to measure and improve OA publication on campus, including CDIL projects,
Pressbook publications, and open access publication by the faculty, particularly related to the
Open Access Publishing Fund
  - Why:
▪ To create a better understanding of and support infrastructure for open access
publishing on campus
  - How:
▪ Use OAPF to help faculty publish their articles as open access
▪ Improve tools and options available for open publishing on campus
▪ Work with Research Impact Team to use VERSO to measure and increase visibility for
open access publications (including OAPF articles) and projects by university faculty

▪ Measure engagement and create persistent open presences for Pressbooks and CDIL
projects via VERSO and its DOI functionalities
  - Success looks like:
▪ OAPF funds expended
▪ DOIs assigned to pressbooks, CDIL projects, and select digital
collections (as decided by team)
▪ Statistics tracked/communicated via VERSO for OAPF and OA
articles generally in OA Campus Report
**Fall update:**
  - Took over the OAPF Collection in VERSO
  - Currently up to date through FY24, includes 147 articles
  - Drafted OAPF VERSO workflow for keeping the collection updated in conjunction
with annual OAPF reports
  - Most catalogued pressbooks added into VERSO and library catalog
  - Other pressbook policies (including DOIs) in progress
  - Proposed metrics to track via VERSO:
  - # of OA-tagged items (4,092)
  - # of OA peer-reviewed journals (1,200)
  - OAPF funding period #1 fully encumbered as of 11/7 ($15,000)
**Spring update:**
  - OAPF funding period #2 fully encumbered as of 3/27 ($15,000)
  - Explored questions related to DOI authority and how to balance that across our diverse
digital ecosystem of Pressbooks, CDIL projects, and other
3) Assess contractual and other opportunities for advancing open activities on campus through
contracts (i.e. Transformative Publishing Agreements, etc.)
**▪ Why:**
- Better understand open publishing possibilities available via subscription
**▪ How:**
▪ Track and assess the various options available to the library via subscription
▪ Communicate opportunities to collections team, the dean, and library faculty
regularly
**▪ Success looks like:**
  - Final report in Spring 2025 that outlines possible contractual opportunities for
increasing open activities on campus
**Fall update:**
  - Received access to tracking data from Rami
  - APC savings from 2023 to 2024: $97,547

  - Identified some ways to improve tracking:
▪ # of departments and colleges represented
▪ Reorganize the data
  - Identified ways to improve communication re: agreements:
  - Add links/lists of specific journals covered under agreement (e.g., Spring Nature only
waives fees for hybrid journal APCs and provides a list on their site)
  - Update call out to transformative agreements on OAPF pages as potential
alternative
  - Update page organization
  - Identified most common publishers from OAPF that could be worth pursuing agreements
**with:**
  - Frontiers (16 OAPF-funded articles)
  - Wiley (15) (I believe this is in progress?)
  - PLOS (8)
**Spring update:**
  - The OAPF FAQ regarding transformative agreements has been updated to reflect the
library’s expanded read and publish agreements, as well as a link to VERSO.
**Unit/Team Metrics:**
▪ # of think open inquiries and applications
  - 0, likely due to Marco being out but also suggests less organic interest than in
previous peak years
▪ # of staff and faculty communications regarding affordability/open
  - 38 contacts regarding OAPF
▪ i/o Publish campus open survey report
  - The scholarly article for the undergraduate results is almost ready. Leesa and Marco are
working on an outreach strategy to share the results.
▪ # of Open Access publications by U of I faculty
▪ 2,261 of 21,508 total faculty & research scholarship items
▪ % of faculty work in RIM system that is openly accessible
  - 10.5% is OA
**Membership:**
▪ Marco Seiferle-Valencia (Lead)
▪ Leesa Love
▪ Bruce Godfrey
▪ Maryelizabeth Koepele

▪ Kelly Omodt
▪ Tyler Rodrigues
▪ Victoria Kerr (Leganto)
**Reporting to:**
- Associate Dean, Research & Instruction
**Final Outcomes**
- Objective 1 – Savings Students Money
  - We did not have new Think Open Fellowships, but we still estimated
$170,000 in annual savings from existing fellowships
  - The Think Open program savings to date is estimated at around $875,000
  - Course reserves saved students around $175,000 this year by offering
required materials for 64 courses, and reaching approximately 2,000
students. This means about 16% of Vandal students are using course
reserves.
- Objective 2 – Leverage Verso and Maintain OAPF
  - Created and updated the OAPF collection in Verso, creating a record of all
scholarship funded by the OAPF since inception
  - Collaborated with other teams to link VERSO, Pressbooks, Library
generated DOI’s, with the library catalog to improve discoverability
- Objective 3 – Assess transformative publishing agreement possibilities
  - Researched and understood transformative publishing agreements
▪ APC savings from 2023 to 2024: $97,547
  - Identified specific strategies to improve communication
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
For objective 1, student savings, our focus will be on outreach to course schedulers, to
ensure existing zero and very low cost courses are marked. We saw a big drop off in marked
courses because the library was not able to do outreach this year. We are also planning to
connect with CETL and hopefully catch more faculty earlier on in their course material decisions
process.
Additionally, we are planning an OA week event and OA-centered podcast, which are
hoped to help demonstrate what we are already doing, celebrate students and faculty who have
been participating in open across campus, and help get people inspired about new projects.
This will also likely be an opportunity to present the findings from the 2023 student course
materials affordability survey.

We will be deemphasizing the cost savings and volume of Think Open fellowships going
forward but still offering them as curricular fellowships through CDIL. We saw less interest in
Think Open this last year, though it is unclear if that is related to Marco being out and there
being less outreach and promotion.
For objective 2, VERSO outreach, the OST may have met our core goals here of making
sure we have strategic connection and representation of OA published properties in VERSO.
Similarly, objective 3, saw a lot of progress, with research and internal Infromation sharing on
transformative publishing agreements. However, more work remains to communicate both these
opportunities to stakeholders and potential users.
These proposed ideas work well with the proposed vision of moving some of the KPI’S
collected by OST to actually being DSOS unit KPI’s, and restructuring and recharging the OST
team to be focused on open campus engagement with the libraries open and cost savings
options.
