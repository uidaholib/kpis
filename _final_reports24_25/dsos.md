Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies Unit 2024-25
**Overview**
The Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies unit enriches learning opportunities and
advances research, scholarly and creative activity related to digital scholarship, open
education, open publishing, web development, and asynchronous and online learning.
Serving as the home for programs such as the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning, the
Open Access Publishing Fund, and the Think Open fellowship program, the unit fosters the
infrastructure and expertise necessary to support and sustain the library’s efforts in digital
projects, services, and project management.

**Library KPIs:**
- Digital Collections
- Research Information Management
- Web Properties
- Fellowships (Primary)
- Student Savings
**Objectives:**
Facilitate access to and preservation of unique collections and scholarly
outputs (CDIL, digitization).
- Why:
  - The library has an important responsibility to steward and promote
University of Idaho’s unique collections and scholarship. Since these
resources may not be formally published and are unavailable anywhere else,
the Library serves as a hub to preserve and provide lasting access to users.
- How:
  - Improve digital archive storage to meet NDSA standards for Level 3 digital
preservation.
  - Ensure the public and campus are made aware of new scholarly productions
and digital collections when released.

  - Ensure scholarly outputs and digital collections are easily discoverable,
useable, and accessible.
- Success looks like:
  - Key faculty and staff are conversant with digital preservation standards and
have documented practices to use digital preservation storage.
  - Regular updates promoting new digital collections and scholarly outputs are
sent out via a variety of communication channels, leading to increased
traffic to new content.
  - Web navigation and discovery of digital collection and digital scholarship is
user friendly and meets accessibility guidelines.
- Fall Updates:
  - Unit members have worked with Spec and Digital Collection Team to
facilitate digital preservation processes. We contributed to discussions on
implementing Archive-It service for web archiving and developing policies for
other born digital workflows. Access to the digital archive drive was updated
and better documented. A step by step review based on NSDA standards has
not yet been completed.
  - Some digital collection update and launch workflows were disrupted due to
the departure of key staff over the summer (Klytie and Sarah). Significant
effort went into rewriting all Digital Collections documentation to include
step by step checklists for all processes to help coordinate activities while
onboarding new members (over 50 commits to the documentation in this
period). This has helped clarify work based in CDIL/DSOS vs Spec and
establishes steps to better record data about activities in the unit. Going
forward, our launch checklist is being followed to help improve
communication of new collections and recorded in our tracking spreadsheet
(2 collections completed the checklist this period). Andrew developed a new
digital screen slideshow display for the Library living room area to highlight
new and featured digital collections.
  - This period saw a complete overhaul of the Digital Collection templates and
home page which brought more consistent branding, updated colors, and
useability and accessibility improvements. Complete redeploying of all
collections was necessary to prep the data used for our Search index.
  - We soft-launched our new Search app and deployed search to 111 of 115
eligible digital collections. This represented a huge investment of time for
DSOS with application development, metadata fixes, collection template
updates/fixes, and redeployment. Metadata for about 100 collections and
60,000 records were updated to ensure better consistency in our aggregated

fields. We also improved data about the collections for better reporting. The
work helped grow confidence and skills of CDIL staff which is essential for
ongoing digital collection and website maintenance.
  - DSOS members have been evaluating the impact of new accessibility
requirements and reviewing our existing web properties. In working towards
accessibility goals, we continued a major project to create and deploy
transcripts for all audio/video items in our collections, adding more than 230
new transcripts (only one collection still has any items needing a transcript,
LCOH—transcripts are created but not yet deployed). We have contributed
accessibility updates to Digital Collections, Inside Idaho, Lib Guides, and
Pressbooks (particularly fixing color contrasts and improving alt text).
  - CDIL lab (Kevin) contributed important work on custom digitization requests
that support research on campus and beyond. These often involved obsolete
formats (VHS, reel-to-reel), consulting on process, and quick turn arounds. 7
request projects were recorded for this period.
  - DSOS members have been involved in exploring possibilities for IR, OA/OER,
and data reporting in VERSO. They have helped develop policies and
transferred data for Ag Extension publications and ETD.
- Spring updates:
  - DSOS supported the creation of 6 new digital collections, moving 4 through
the collection launch process (to ensure communication to the public and
internal audiences). Completed maintenance for regularly updated archive
projects such as Mc Clure Center Archive and Friday Letter, and outreach
projects such as Digital Library of Idaho. Restarted IWDL in collaboration
with IWRRI with major redesign and new data.
  - Significant work was done on refining metadata and fixing consistency
issues (which were easier to detect due to the work done on prepping data
for the Search app). Location fields were normalized across dozens of
collections to improve discoverability and usefulness of the data.
  - CDIL lab has worked with students to integrate AI summarization with
human review to speed up metadata creation for large PDF collections.
  - DSOS members and students have worked to enhance existing oral history
transcripts with better copyediting and work on Spanish language materials.
  - DSOS members worked on policy and workflow for creating DOIs for
published digital scholarship and Pressbooks projects.
  - Continued development of Search app, refined workflow for ingest, and
started establishing new self-managed hosting servers.

  - Consulted and helped with web migration and archiving for people impacted
by main University web hosting changes. This has led to some new collection
content such as Michigan Nitrogen Gradient Study.
  - Migrated Library files and content off old webpages server to new locations
(due to IT hosting changes).
Provide collaborative opportunities for learning and project development (e.g.
fellowships programs and collaborative digital scholarship projects) that
impact campus research and teaching.
- Why:
  - The Library’s unique resources and expertise can directly impact scholarship
on campus by opening new research and learning opportunities. This
includes developing OER to impact costs and empower instructors, and
developing digital methods that enable unique research and
communication.
- How:
  - Facilitate Think Open Fellowships.
  - Facilitate CDIL Digital Scholarship student and faculty fellowships.
  - Maintain, develop, and improve digital scholarship on campus through CDIL.
  - Organize campus events for fellows to publicly share projects and
outcomes.
- What success looks like:
  - Fellowship programs receive competitive applications.
  - Fellows publish their projects, present to audiences at the library, and are
promoted online.
  - Publication of 2-3 significant digital scholarship projects.
- Fall updates:
  - CDIL fellowships were prepped for applications in Spring. Data about
fellowships was gathered to prepare for a more centralized representation of
the work and outputs.
  - DSOS/CDIL hosted the Library Fellowship Showcase in October with three
fellows presenting. DSOS members have taken an active role in facilitating
the MRIC presentations move into the Library (including weekly work from
Kevin to assemble and deploy an A/V setup).
  - DSOS has collaborated on a wide variety of digital scholarship projects with
faculty and students. We provided ongoing support to Spec, CDIL, and Think

Open fellows’ projects (more than 5 during this period). Outputs published in
**Fall 2024 include:**
▪ School of Cello Playing, Mirada Wilson (Music, faculty) - translation
project with Evan Williamson, published on Pressbooks.
▪ Basic Financial Education Curriculum for Students, Upal Kundu and
Udit Sipani (ASUI, undergraduates) - literacy project with Leesa Love,
published on Pressbooks.
▪ Aural Skills, Miranda Wilson (Music, faculty) - open textbook
converted to Pressbooks project for potential reuse.
▪ The Cook Undergraduate Research Journal (CURJ), with Markie
Mc Brayer and Florian Justwan (Political Science, faculty) -
undergraduate research journal project.
▪ Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Technology Collection, final publishing of
long grant funded scholarship project, with significant custom
features.
  - DSOS members also did significant consultations with researchers across
campus, reporting over 12 meetings during the fall semester. We taught over
10 public workshops / class sessions related to our area.
- Spring updates:
  - Continued extensive collaboration and consultation around digital
**scholarship projects, including:**
▪ Context Podcast Digital Collection, collaborating with Idaho
Humanities Council, an archive of podcasts.
▪ Taylor Wilderness Research Station Archive, a variety of collaborators
from Taylor, Confluence Lab, and CDIL to complete a complex
archive of documents, research, artifacts, and oral histories.
▪ Martin Journal, collaborating with Martin Institute, migrating from
main university website to library hosting, and establishing new
journal home page.
▪ Moscow High School Archaeology, Massey Jordan and Kat Eichner
(Anthropology), public outreach project highlighting work done at
MHS and the stories artifacts can tell.
▪ Tender Spaces, Alicia Gladman (English), completed CDIL fellowship
project featuring oral history braided narrative.
▪ Travelers in Egypt, Matthew Strupp and Sarah Ketchley (Uof W MLIS),
consulted on collection with objects hosted by Internet Archive.
▪ Chinese American Heritage in Idaho, Matt Fuerst (Anthropology),
resources for Chinese American Heritage in Idaho Teaching Trunk.

  - Selected CDIL fellows for 2025. We had 12 complete graduate applications,
4 complete undergrad applications, and 1 faculty development application
coming from 9 different programs across campus. Both groups were highly
competitive with several truly excellent applications. Applications were
reviewed by a committee, and we selected a grad, undergrad, and faculty
development fellow who have started work for summer 2025.
  - Hosted CDIL Digital Scholarship Camp for fellows and librarians to
collaboratively learn about the web, digital exhibits, and digital scholarship.
Facilitate social and technical infrastructure for open publishing both on
campus and worldwide (OAPF, web development, Pressbooks).
- Why:
  - The Library invests in the future of publishing beyond traditional subscription
models, supporting and developing alternative open publishing
opportunities to increase access to knowledge.
- How:
  - Pressbooks platform and service is promoted, documented, and maintained
for campus users.
  - Open Access Publishing Fund is managed to directly support open
publishing for U of I researchers.
  - Collection Builder and related approaches are developed and promoted for
sustainable web projects.
  - Meetings and events are hosted that promote Digital Scholarship and Open
scholarship collaboration on campus.
- What success looks like:
  - Use of Pressbooks to create OER and other projects increases.
  - Metrics for OAPF continue to show impact supporting open publishing.
  - Collection Builder continues to get engagement beyond campus.
- Fall updates:
  - The Pressbooks home was revised to improve presentation and catalog
consistency. Leesa has worked on documenting best practices for
Pressbook service and growing our capacity to support projects. She has
developed Pressbooks templates, covers, draft policies, project
management document template, and better data for tracking projects. 2
new Pressbooks projects were published (listed above section), and 2

additional projects created. Additionally, 5 Pressbooks were added to the
Library’s main catalog and VERSO, and 4 were promoted.
  - OAPF continued as normal, closing in period #1 early with high demand.
Leesa took over leadership of the program and everything went smoothly.
  - Collection Builder opened applications for the second round of the LIS
Student Program and received over 70 applications from 25 different
schools. The CB blog and Slack have seen increased engagement. CB team
has collaborated on a number of projects beyond campus, including:
▪ Lauren Mc Cormick (grad, Princeton University), Judean Pillar Figurine
Exhibit, "Let There Be Light: Recoloring Ancient Artifacts",
https://laurmcco.github.io/judeanpillarfigurineexhibit/
- Spring updates:
  - OAPF period #2 closed as normal, successfully spending out FY25 funding.
  - Several new projects have started in Pressbooks and new contacts
expressing interest.
  - Collection Builder IMLS grant was terminated, ending funding. However, LIS
Student program continued with 12 students (several dropped out after
funding cut disruption). CB Digital Librarian Cohort program received 35
quality applications from 34 institutions. After funding was cut, 6 librarians
decided to join the cohort without funding. CB team members presented at a
conference and taught a week long course at DHSI. Major updates were
added to the templates, including a new About page layout and advanced
search features on Browse—these features are driven by our digital
scholarship projects on campus and are refined for reuse to enhance the
public templates. Consulted on a variety of external projects, including
Michael Aronson’s Historic Theaters project.
  - Established a new Open Journals System instance for hosting journals at
domain “journals.lib.uidaho.edu”. Initially set up for the Fire Lookout
Journal, but will be available for other future projects.

Final Outcomes 2024-25
After significant personnel changes in the previous year, 2024-25 saw DSOS add a new
faculty member (Leesa Love filling the newly designed Open Publishing Librarian position)
and new staff member (Maryelizabeth Koepele, filling Digital Projects Manager position).
Personnel activity was also impacted by the unavoidable extended absence of one of our
faculty members. The previous year saw huge change in our digital infrastructure, which
also impacted our activities in 2024-25, with new national requirements (accessibility rules
update), IT mandated changes (webpages hosting changes and main university web
redesign), and Library initiatives (Digital Collections Search app and metadata
aggregation). DSOS has flexibly adapted to continue making progress on our objectives
while growing internal skills to sustain our projects.
**Reflection on 2024-25 objectives:**

- Facilitate access to and preservation of unique collections and scholarly outputs –
the unit made key improvements to better communicate about our collections and
make them more discoverable.
  - Improved workflow for launching new collections and recording data about
the processes.
  - Rebranding and improved navigation of Digital Collections area of the Library
website, clarifying the purpose and scope of the collections.
  - Launch of new Digital Collections Search that centralizes full text search of
all digital collection content, and continued development and refinement of
the application. Work also included significant enhancement of digital
collection metadata to improve the consistency and value of the aggregated
data.
  - Accessibility improvements, including text transcripts for all audio and video
collection items, to enhance useability for all people.
  - Direct collaboration with others across campus to help develop alternative
hosting of unique content impacted by IT mandated changes to hosting on
their main website and old webpages server.
  - Although work was done on our digital archive drive (improving
documentation, discussion of NDSA standards, exploration of new more
extensible hardware to meet growing storage needs), we did not complete a
formal assessment following NDSA and will carry that goal forward to next
year.
- Provide collaborative opportunities for learning and project development (e.g.
fellowships programs and collaborative digital scholarship projects) that impact
campus research and teaching – the unit did significant collaboration with faculty
and students across campus to create and publish unique scholarship and build
skills.
  - CDIL published above the targeted number of unique projects with fellows
and others on campus, building strong collaborations which led to unique
scholarship that is openly shared. The Think Open Fellowship was closed,
although work continued on several projects.
  - New publishing opportunities have opened up with Pressbooks and student
“journals” hosted with the library.
  - CDIL hosted one successful public presentation event, contributed to
workshops, MRIC, and a fellows training event.
- Facilitate social and technical infrastructure for open publishing both on campus
and worldwide – the unit continues to develop support for open publishing and
digital scholarship that impact campus and beyond.

  - OAPF continues to see demand and successfully spent out the funding.
  - Pressbooks service was improved and has started to gain traction on
campus. An OJS instance was started to support potential journal
publishing.
  - Collection Builder continues to have worldwide engagement, while enabling
our local digital scholarship projects. The termination of grant funding will
limit future travel and outreach opportunities, but will not hamper continuing
development.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
The current objectives seem to still embody meaningful goals for DSOS going into 2025-26,
with slight tweaks to the specifics listed in “how” sections. Here are some challenges and
opportunities that will impact our work next year:
- Updates to Title II ADA requirements for web accessibility: new rules which come
into effect in 2026 have led to a lot of confusion and challenges in digital libraries.
We have already done significant work evaluating and improving digital collections
and other resources to meet the requirements. However, further challenges may
remain as details of the ruling become clearer. We will need to devote time to
evaluating potential issues, reprocessing PDF files, and remediating older areas of
our web content.
- Rethinking Think Open: with the Open area at full strength, some changes in
statewide mandates, and growing capacity with publishing, we have an opportunity
to reshape the Think Open Fellowship program and area. We anticipate CDIL
making support for open publishing and OER more explicitly part of our “digital
scholarship” activities. We hope to build more capacity for open digital publishing
in the library with DOIs, communication, and discoverability that can support
scholarly communication on campus.
- Lack of grant funding for Collection Builder: with IMLS and NEH grants being
terminated and new funding unlikely to arise, we will have less money to support
travel and outreach for Collection Builder, and less salary funds paid to the library
from contributions to other external grant projects. This will reduce our flexibility
and require careful thought about how to allocate limited resources. Faculty may
need to explore new alternative funding and networking opportunties.
