Meeting Minutes
- 2024-2025_running Meeting Minutes.docx
**Objectives:**
- OBJECTIVE #1: Maintain or enhance Primo as an accessible and inclusive discovery tool, by
identifying features/options for implementation.
  - Why:
▪ Primo is one of the library’s primary discovery tools and is used by patrons to
identify information relevant to their educational needs.
  - How:
▪ Make recommendations/decisions on configurations, following each new Primo
quarterly release.
▪ Create/maintain/analyze relevant analytics reports related to Primo usage
▪ Map configuration changes to relevant analytics reports for analysis
  - Success looks like:
▪ Implementation of new Primo features useful to patrons.
▪ Decisions made on configuration based on patron usage.
  - Fall Update:
▪ This semester, the team tested four new Primo VE features and decided
collectively not to implement any of them at this time.
  - Spring Update:
▪ This semester, the team tested three new Primo VE features and decided
collectively not to implement any of them at this time.
- OBJECTIVE #2: Ensure cohesion among the library’s various discovery tools.

  - Why:
▪ To ensure a consistent patron experience as they use various tools to find the
information they need.
  - How:
▪ Review and test library discovery tools.
▪ Identify inconsistencies in search mechanisms, design, and branding among
discovery tools available on the library’s website.
▪ Identify changes that will contribute to a consistent patron experience.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Similar or well-defined search mechanisms, design, and branding among
discovery tools.
  - Fall Update
▪ The team developed a plan for reviewing the discovery tools, focusing on
documenting observations related to search scope and accuracy, design and
branding consistency, user experience issues or barriers, and recommendations
for improvements. The team is scheduled to meet in February 2025 to discuss
findings from these observations, aiming to address the KPI for Objective #2:
ensuring cohesion among the library’s various discovery tools.
  - Spring Update
▪ Each team member tested one or more discovery tools and documented their
findings on search scope and accuracy, design and branding consistency, user
experience issues or barriers, and recommendations for improvements. Several
inconsistencies in search mechanisms, design, and branding among discovery
tools have been identified and corrected.
**Final Outcomes**
This year, the team evaluated new Primo VE features and collectively decided not to implement any at
this time. Additionally, the team successfully tested nine discovery tools and resolved the identified
inconsistencies. Both objectives for the year were fully accomplished.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
Looking ahead, the team will engage in several projects over the summer, including reviewing the
language used for ILL/Summit services, assessing EBSCO’s Natural Language Search functionality, and
conducting usability testing of an AI research assistant. In the coming year, the team will continue
evaluating new Primo VE features and work to optimize related discovery tools.
