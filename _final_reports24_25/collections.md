**COLLECTIONS TEAM, 2024-2025**
**Overview:**
The Collections Team is responsible for leading the development of the Library’s general collections,
which includes working in conjunction with subject liaisons and ensuring existing collections budgets are
being spent efficiently. They ensure the campus community is able to provide feedback on the Library’s
collections and investigate new opportunities for resource acquisitions.
**Library KPIs:**
- Relevant
- Course Reserves
- Electronic Resources
- Online Catalog
- Physical Circulation
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Review the library’s existing general collection resources and analyze usage
- Why:
  - To maximize university investments through the library and responsibly steward
university resources
- How:
  - Identify and analyze overlapping subscriptions in our existing collections.
  - Identify potential new subscriptions aligned with the library’s collection development
goals.
  - Create, maintain, and analyze circulation reports for both approval plan and firm order
acquisitions.
- Success Looks Like:
  - Recommendations given based on analyzing a selection of our existing collection
  - Recommendations given on new subscriptions throughout the year
  - Reports shared with selectors and recommendations given on those reports
- Fall Update
  - On a monthly basis, usage statistics were reviewed of every collection due for renewal
in 1-2 months. Recommendations were made to the Dean for renewal or cancellation
per that discussion. We have made progress developing circulation reports for our
approval plan and firm order titles, with a goal of producing reports to enable liaisons to
make adjustments to their spending or to the approval plan.
- Spring Update
  - On a monthly basis, usage statistics were reviewed of every collection due for renewal
in 1-2 months. Recommendations were made to the Dean for renewal or cancellation
per that discussion. In Spring, we added overlap analyses, where relevant, to the
renewal process. We have also initiated a process of evaluating the approval and firm
order purchasing patterns with circulation data and making changes to the approval
plan.
Ensure two-way communication with campus community about collections
- Why:

  - To ensure the campus is aware of existing resources and to provide an opportunity for
feedback in case of changes to the collections
- How:
  - Identify underperforming electronic subscriptions.
  - Develop promotional plan to publicize and increase use of selected collections.
  - In conjunction with liaisons, develop process to gather patron feedback
  - Analyze community feedback 2-3 months in advance of renewal deadline.
- Success Looks Like:
  - Cancellation or changes to underperforming subscriptions
  - Collections promoted through Marketing and Communications Team channels
  - Feedback collected on underperforming subscriptions
- Fall Update
  - During Fall 2024, we maintained contributions to the Library’s newsletter, Letters from
the Library, that promoted collections that we sought to raise awareness of. We also
used the liaison program to reach and gather information regarding potential cuts when
appropriate.
- Spring Update
  - In Spring, we continued to eliminate underperforming resources and promoted
resources through the Letters from the Library newsletter. As appropriate, we used the
liaison program to evaluate the potential loss of subscriptions before making a decision.
Make recommendations on collection renewals, new subscriptions, approval plan purchasing, and firm
order areas of emphasis.
- Why:
  - To maintain a rich, diverse, and valued set of collections
- How:
  - Recommendation at least one month prior to renewal deadline for continuation or
cancellation of each subscription resource.
  - Report to selectors and admin at least once per year on trends in firm order circulation
  - Report to selectors and admin at least once per year on trends in approval plan
circulation, with recommendation for changes as needed.
  - Determine CPU standards (e.g., minimum acceptable usage) for non-journal content like
A&I databases
- Success Looks Like:
  - Meeting renewal deadlines
  - Receiving feedback from selectors regarding trends in approval/firm order circulation
- Fall Update
  - We have met all of our renewal deadlines in the Fall 2024 with recommendations. We
are currently creating/designing reports to send out to selectors regarding trends in
book circulation. We have not yet addressed CPU standards for non-journal content.
- Spring Update
  - We have continued to meet our renewal deadlines. In Spring we sent reports to the
liaisons regarding book ordering in different LC subject areas to get feedback on changes
to ordering. Having received little feedback, we have moved forward with plans to shift
more book spending onto demand-driven channels and re-educate liaisons on book
ordering procedures and processes.

  - We have also begun to address standards for CPU-like measures for non-journal
content. Discovery and Acquisitions developed a spreadsheet to use in comparing
similar non-journal content’s CPUs (i.e. full-text databases, abstracting and indexing
services, etc.) and identifying the proper usage metrics for those resources (e.g. for A&I
services looking at searches vs. investigations). This will allow us to consider the value of
those databases separately from journal content. We also have reports on ebook usage
and are beginning to review that content.

**Final Outcomes**
The Collections Team maintained strong, consistent progress on achieving our team goals. We kept at
improving our processes for evaluating collections on time and in advance of deadlines. We added
elements to improve the quality of our decision-making, like the introduction of overlap analysis and a
rethinking of our metrics used in evaluating abstracting and indexing databases. We also tackled the
approval and firm order project with more verve this year, yielding some improvements in our data – we
identified a few process errors that affected our information – and a plan to adjust our approval plans to
better fit our campus needs and requirements.
**Accomplishments**
- Produced better circulation and ordering analyses for making decisions about approval plans
and firm ordering
- Identified errors in some of our processes that affected data and reports
- Consistently renewed or cancelled resources on time and schedule, giving each resource its
consideration
- With approximate $96,000 of inflation going into FY25, we were able to trim the continuing
resources budget by $103,694
- Adding a long-sought engineering standards resource in the ASTM Compass database
- Began to develop a process for reviewing non-journal resources in a systematic way by
producing better reports and data to use in evaluating them

- Produced a regular Letters from the Library feature to highlight resources
**Challenges**
- Some of our evaluations are still in their infancy – evaluating Read and Publish agreements, for
example. They are complex and there are a range of ways to evaluate them.
- Usage for print materials continues to decline. There is a tension between following metrics (like
usage) as targets and building formative and quality scholarly collections regardless of metrics,
especially for a research library.
- Future cuts to the collections may be increasingly fraught. Some of the items that are seeing
declining use but cost quite a bit may be more politically challenging or seemingly essential to a
discipline.
- Liaisons as a feedback mechanism hasn’t been too productive (exception of those on the
Collections Team).
**Opportunities**
- More direct engagement with liaisons at the Collections Team meetings to invite dialogue and
feedback.
- Shift more book purchasing onto demand-driven channels, such as implementing faculty
requests in Primo/Alma.
- Formalize more variation in how liaisons manage their collections – encouraging those with less
investment in doing collection development to automate more of their processes, while
allowing others to do more bespoke collection development.
