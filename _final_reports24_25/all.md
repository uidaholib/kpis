Access & Engagement Unit, Academic Year 2024-25
**Overview:**
The Access & Engagement Unit encompasses Access Services and Reference Services. Within
each of these areas, supporting our patrons and forming connections with them is crucial. In
Access Services in the Main Library and Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC), we seek to
“connect [in-person and virtual U of I affiliate and community members] to library resources,”
course reserves, spaces, and technology.1 In Reference Services, we seek to “assist, advise, and
instruct [in-person and virtual U of I affiliates and community members]” in finding, accessing, and
evaluating information related to their information and research needs.2 The work of this unit
occurs synchronously and asynchronously.
**Library KPIs:**
- Primary Responsibility
  - Building Usage
  - Course Reserves
  - Research and Reference Assistance
- Relevant
  - Online Catalog
  - Physical Circulation
  - Student Savings

Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Facilitate physical and electronic Course Reserves
- Why:
  - Save students money and increase access to required and recommended course
materials
- How:
  - Support faculty and instructors in their use of Course Reserves

  - Ensure that website information is kept up-to-date
  - Collaborate with the Open Strategies Team to advertise Course Reserves services
  - Seek feedback from the campus community
- Success looks like:
  - Continued or increased usage of Course Reserves by faculty and instructors
  - Positive interactions with faculty and instructors
  - Continued cost-savings for students
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - 89 instructors (excluding those teaching ENGL 101/102 and MATH 170/175/275)
across 103 courses and 40 subjects utilized Course Reserves for required and/or
recommended readings in fall 2024. These courses served approximately 6,969
enrolled students and in total, physical course reserves circulated 107 times,
Controlled Digital Lending items were viewed 4,646 times, and four additional
ebook licenses were purchased based on turnaway notifications. We estimate that
Course Reserves saved enrolled students over $474,000 on the purchase of
required and recommended physical items across all courses utilizing this service.
Cost-savings by discipline ranged from $718.40 across all Biological Engineering
courses to $83,109.90 across all English courses, with the average cost-savings by
discipline equaling $11,871.56. These data are affected by the number of courses
utilizing course reserves, within each discipline, and the number of students
enrolled in these courses. Estimated cost-savings of items on Course Reserves, by
all discipline is available in Sheet 2 of the Fall 2024 metrics spreadsheet. This is the
first year that we’ve gathered data on all courses using Course Reserves, instead of
just courses who utilize this service for required readings. As such, a comparison
between fall 2024 and AY 2023 – 2024 data is not feasible. However, current usage
of Course Reserves by instructors as well as the number of circulations and views
of items on Course Reserves appears to indicate that the Library is filling a need on
campus. Data gathered for future reports will allow us to more clearly identify if
usage continues or increases over time.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - 76 instructors (excluding those teaching ENGL 101/102 and MATH 170/175/275)
across 91 courses and 41 subjects utilized Course Reserves for required and/or
recommended readings in spring 2025; these courses served approximately 5,396
enrolled students.
  - In total, physical course reserves circulated 253 times, Controlled Digital Lending
items were viewed 3,653 times, and two additional ebook licenses were purchased
based on turnaway notifications.
  - We estimate that Course Reserves saved enrolled students over $417,000 on the
purchase of required and recommended physical items across all courses utilizing
this service.
  - Cost-savings by discipline were the largest for History courses and smallest for
Curriculum & Instruction courses. These data are affected by the number of
courses utilizing Course Reserves, the number of items on reserve for each course,
and the number of students enrolled in these courses.

  - The estimated cost-savings of items on Course Reserves, across all disciplines, are
available in Sheet 2 of the Spring 2025 metrics spreadsheet.
  - Current usage of Course Reserves by instructors as well as the number of
circulations and views of items on Course Reserves appears to indicate that the
Library is filling a need on campus.
- Final outcomes
  - Over the last year, Course Reserves were utilized by instructors across more than
40 subjects. Physical items were checked out 360 times and Controlled Digital
Lending items were viewed more than 8,200 times. These data appear to indicate
that the Library is filling a need on campus.
  - The cost-savings metric we use for physical items demonstrates that Course
Reserves saves students across campus a combined total of more than $400,000
per semester. Savings appear to be largest for students enrolled in English and
History courses and smallest for students enrolled in Biological Engineering and
Curriculum & Instruction courses. However, these cost-savings data are not perfect
and vary based on the number of courses utilizing Course Reserves, the number of
items on reserve for each course, the number of students enrolled in these courses,
and the accuracy of the average book cost used.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - Moving forward, it would be useful to investigate whether other cost-saving metrics
could provide a more accurate picture of the impact of Course Reserves on student
costs. Right now, we are using an average book cost to determine cost-savings, but
in the future, it could be worth exploring whether we could use actual book costs
(as shared on the bookstore’s website or Amazon) for each course to determine
cost-savings. This would require much more time on the part of staff to gather these
data and calculate the cost-savings, but it might lead to more accurate data.
  - There might also be an opportunity to partner more closely with liaisons, who can
contact faculty of courses with high enrollment prior to the semester and offer to
purchase required texts for Course Reserves.
  - One ongoing challenge is gathering qualitative feedback from instructors and
students on Course Reserves. Starting in Fall 2025, the Library will conduct focus
group with students across campus and we hope that these conversations will
result in data that can inform our services.
Review and maintain physical collection stacks
- Why:
  - Save patron time
  - Increase usability of physical collection stacks
  - Reduce patron confusion
- How:
  - Shelve returned and new items in a timely manner
  - Conduct ongoing review of physical collection stacks for accuracy, damage,
cleanliness, and order
- Sucess looks like:

  - Reduction in un-loaned items labelled as missing
  - Orderly and accurate physical collection stacks
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Main Library Access Services continued their review of physical collection stacks,
reviewing the A-G call number ranges. During their review, they identified more than
500 missing/lost items, 20 mis-shelved items, 8 items with call number issues, and
134 items not in Alma. Throughout the course of the semester, they pulled 296
items for mending and 602 duplicate items for review by subject librarians. They
also identified 686 un-loaned items as missing. This time-consuming collection
maintenance work ensures that patrons are able to find what they need when they
visit our stacks. In Fall 2024, the Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC) added 696
items to their collection and removed/deleted 819 items. Again, this work ensures
that our collections are usable and relevant for our patrons.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Main Library Access Services continued their review of physical collection stacks,
reviewing the E-F call number ranges.
▪ During their review, they identified more than 1,200 missing/lost items, 19
mis-shelved items, 28 items with call number issues, and 53 items not in
Alma.
▪ Throughout the course of the semester, they pulled 878 items for mending
and mended 332 items
▪ 665 duplicate items or multiple editions were also pulled for review by
subject librarians.
  - The Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC) added 1,214 items to their collection
and removed/deleted 333 items.
- Final outcomes
  - Reviewing and maintaining the Main Library’s and GSCC’s physical stacks is a time-
consuming, but beneficial task that ensures that our collections are usable and
accessible for our patrons.
  - The comparison between Alma and the Main Library’s physical stacks has resulted
in the identification of more than 1,700 missing/lost items, 39 mis-shelved items, 36
items with call number issues, and 187 items not in Alma.
  - Over the course of the year, more than 600 items were mended, and more than
1,200 duplicates/multiple editions were pulled for review by subject librarians.
  - This was also a busy year for the GSCC, with the addition of more than 1,900 new
items. This year’s curriculum adoption was English Language Arts.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - The project workflow for comparing Alma and the Main Library’s physical stacks will
shift slightly based on discussions between the Access Services Manager, Unit
Head for Access & Engagement, and the Associate Dean of Operations & Access
once the fourth floor is complete.
▪ Continue the comparison between Alma and the stacks
- Identifying mis-shelved items, missing items, etc.
▪ Reduce mending criteria

- Only pull those items that are falling apart, moldy, or needing a new
label
▪ Reach out to liaisons once to ask about duplicates/multiple editions
- Ask if they want a list to review for any of their call number areas, or
if they want to keep/remove all duplicates and older editions,
keeping the most recent
Provide relevant and timely point-of-need Reference and Circulation services
- Why:
  - Ensure that Access & Engagement service points reflect the current needs of
patrons
- How:
  - Track and analyze point-of-need service point interactions
  - Track and analyze data on hold requests
  - Seek feedback from the campus community
- Success looks like:
  - Positive interactions with patrons
  - Monitoring usage of point-of-need Reference and Circulation services and making
recommendations based on data
  - Completing IDOC resident students’ ‘Requests For More Sources’ within one week
of receipt
  - Filling hold requests for physical items (held by U of I Library) in timely manner
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Reference, Main Library Access Services, and GSCC employees staffed their
service points at various hours throughout the semester. In Fall 2024, Reference
received 1,691 questions (a 2.2% increase when compared to Fall 2023) and the
GSCC received 380 questions (a 55% increase when compared to Fall 2023). In Fall
2024, 68% of reference questions were classified as READ level 2 or higher, while
only 54% were classified similarly in Fall 2023. Main Library Access Services
continued to utilize Lib Answers to track questions and began a basic desk count in
late October, reporting more than 2,000 interactions with patrons. These data are
currently being used to inform schedules and service models, with both Reference
and the GSCC considering changes to their hours in future semesters. In fall 2024,
the Reference Coordinator, Access Services Manager, and Unit Head also began
discussing cross-training Access Services students on known-item reference
assistance. So far, we’ve surveyed students about their knowledge and experience
answering reference questions and met to discuss our goals for training. An initial
training is planned for February 2025 and will include Main Library and GSCC
Access Services student employees, with the goal of holding smaller/shorter check-
in trainings in the future. Four IDOC requests were received in fall 2024, with
librarians completing these requests within 2.5 days, on average, and the entire
request being completed within 9 days. Hold requests for physical items were filled
at a consistently fast rate, with the time between request submission and
placement on the hold shelf averaging 30.9 hours, or 1.2 days (this data is available

in Alma Analytics/Shared Folders/University of Idaho/Reports/Access and
Engagement/Average Time-Holds Processed).
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Reference received 1,074 questions (a 21% decrease when compared to Spring
2024).
▪ 68% of reference questions were classified as READ level 2 or higher, while
only 63% were classified similarly in Spring 2024.
▪ When looking at questions by format and READ Level, 89.6% of IM questions
were rated as READ Level 2 or above, compared to 52.8% of in-person
questions.
- In Spring 2024, 81.9% of IM questions were rated as READ Level 2 or
above, compared to 48% of in-person questions.
  - The GSCC received 278 questions (a 17% increase when compared to Spring 2024).
  - Main Library Access Services continued to utilize Lib Answers and a basic desk
count to track questions, reporting more than 3,601 interactions with patrons.
  - The Reference Coordinator provided a cross-training session for Access Services
students on known-item reference assistance. Unfortunately, only a small number
of students were able to attend.
  - Reference support of IDOC requests for more sources ended in Spring 2025 as the
Idaho Department of Correction was able to participate in the JSTOR Access in
Prison Initiative.
- Final outcomes
  - In AY 2024 – 2025, reference received 2,765 questions, an 8.5% decrease when
compared to AY 2023 – 2024.
▪ READ Level 2 questions and higher increased by 7.9% in AY 2024 – 2025
when compared to the previous academic year.
▪ Most questions in AY 2024 – 2025 came from U of I affiliates (89%) and more
than half of all questions were asked in-person (57.6%). These statistics are
on par with what was reported in AY 2023 – 2024.
▪ When looking at questions by format and READ Level, 91.7% of IM questions
were rated as READ Level 2 or above, compared to 53.7% of in-person
questions. In comparison, in AY 2023 – 2024, 73.7% of IM questions were
rated as READ Level 2 or above, compared to 44.9% of in-person questions
  - The GSCC received 658 questions, a 39% increase in questions when compared to
AY 2023 – 2024.
▪ A plurality of questions in AY 2024 – 2025 were related to book requests
(24.3%), most questions came from students (65.3%), and almost all
questions were asked in-person (93%).
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - Errors in the Alma Analytics report created to track timing for fulfilling hold requests
and the inability to separate out Summit requests meant that the data associated
with this metric were inaccurate in Fall 2024 and could not be reported in Spring
2025. Looking ahead, more time will need to be spent within Analytics to see if this

data can be generated. If not, it will be necessary to identity other metrics to track
the rate of filling hold requests for physical items (held by U of I Library).
  - Starting in Fall 2025, we plan to schedule shorter, check-in trainings with Access
Services students throughout the semester.
Provide timely access to the Main Library and Gary Strong Curriculum Center (GSCC)
- Why:
  - Ensure that Main Library and GSCC building hours reflect the current needs of
patrons
- How:
  - Gather and analyze gate count data
  - Analyze space usage gathered by other Units/Teams
  - Seek feedback from the campus community
- Success looks like:
  - Continued or increased usage of the Main Library and GSCC during open hours
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Between August 2024 and December 2024, the Main Library gate count reported
more than 122,527 visitors, a 7% decrease when compared to Fall 2023. However,
these numbers are lower than expected as the gate counter malfunctioned and
stopped counting at various times throughout the semester. Even with these issues,
data do indicate an 11% increase in footfalls in October 2024 when compared to
October 2023. The GSCC also had consistently high usage with a total of 924
visitors, with 365 footfalls in September 2024 alone. Space tracking undertaken by
Main Library Access Services also indicates consistently high usage of the Library’s
open and reservable spaces. Data collection last year was inconsistent so a
comparison is not feasible, but data from Fall 2024 indicate that first-floor open
spaces averaged more than 4,000 users per month, with October being the busiest
month. The open and reservable group study rooms on the first, third, and fourth
floors averaged 105 users per month, while the reservable individual study rooms
averaged 34 users per month. Although a few study carrels were used frequently,
overall, these spaces showed limited use, with occupants identified as using these
spaces only approximately 7 times per month, on average.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Between January 2025 and May 2025, the Main Library gate count reported
approximately 129,316 visitors, a 22% increase in footfalls when compared to
Spring 2024.
▪ The open spaces on the first floor were the most used area in the Main
Library and the first-floor reservable group study rooms had the most usage,
on average, when compared to other reservable and open study rooms.
▪ Usage of the Data Hub space increased 85% between Fall 2024 and Spring
2025.
  - Space tracking undertaken by Main Library Access Services also indicates
consistently high usage of the Library’s open and reservable spaces.

▪ Data indicate that first-floor open spaces averaged more than 3,400 users
per month, with February being the busiest month.
▪ The open and reservable group study rooms on the first, third, and fourth
floors averaged 82 users per month, while the reservable individual study
rooms averaged 27 users per month.
▪ Space tracking identified users in all 12 study carrels at least once during
the semester. Overall, these spaces showed limited use when compared to
the two reservable individual study rooms, with occupants identified as
using these spaces approximately 4 times per month, on average.
  - The GSCC reported fewer visitors in Spring 2025 (670 visitors) than in Fall 2024, with
January and April being their busiest months.
- Final outcomes
  - In AY 2024 – 2025, the Main Library gate count reported approximately 251,843
visitors, a 3% decrease when compared to AY 2023 – 2024. We did experience gate
counter malfunctions in Fall 2024 and consider this decrease minor.
  - Space tracking undertaken by Main Library Access services indicates that the open
spaces on the first floor were the most used area in the Main Library.
▪ The first-floor reservable group study rooms had the most usage, on
average, when compared to other reservable and open study rooms.
▪ Usage of the Data Hub space increased approximately 84% between Fall
2024 and Spring 2025.
▪ On average, carrel usage was low when compared to the usage of the two
reservable individual study rooms.
  - The GSCC’s tracking sheet indicates 1,594 visitors during AY 2024 – 2025, with a
total of 12 class visits.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - After collecting space tracking data for an entire academic year and being more
diligent in confirming that the gate counter is functional, we can begin the process
of examining the Main Library’s open hours to determine if they still meet the needs
of our campus community as well as considering whether we need more student
employees at specific times of time of the day. We might also be able to leverage
the upcoming focus groups to gauge the times when students use or want to use
the Library.
▪ Based on the space tracking data, we also have the information necessary
to justify transitioning additional carrells to reservable individual study
rooms.
  - Across the Main Library and GSCC, we can potentially use gate count and space
tracking data to inform when we want to host Library events.
  - Consistency in completing space tracking in the Main Library improved in Spring
2025, but gaps in data collection remain. As we move into the next academic year,
we will need to ensure that student employees remain diligent in this work and that
gaps are minimized.
Timebound: Investigate new reference model options

- Why:
  - Ensure that the reference model used meet the needs of patrons based on point-of-
need interaction data
- How:
  - Review reference models at other academic libraries
  - Review point-of-need reference interactions
  - Discuss model options with Reference group and Library leadership
- Success looks like:
  - By the end of the year, develop a list of reference model options, with pros and cons
for each option, and a recommendation for AY 2025 – 2026
- Fall update (8/19/2024 - 12/31/2024)
  - Reference librarians generated a list of three reference models with pros and cons
for each option. These were shared with the Dean of Libraries and Associate Dean
of Operations and Access.
- Spring update (1/1/2025 - 5/9/2025)
  - Following additional conversations with the Dean of Libraries and Associate Dean
of Operations and Access as well as meetings with the Reference group, Reference
Services will pursue a pilot project for AY 2025 – 2026.
▪ This will include moving the Reference Desk to the second floor, having two
librarians staff a larger portion of open hours, and inviting colleagues
outside Access & Engagement to staff the desk.
- Final outcomes
  - Reference Services spent the year exploring the philosophical and practical
implications of changes to our reference model.
  - We believe that shifting to a model where two librarians staff a larger portion of
open hours, rather than equally dividing hours amongst the Reference group,
ensures that we maintain a high level of service, while also ensuring that librarians
have sufficient time to step away from the desk and engage in other aspects of their
jobs.
- Challenges and opportunities for next year
  - Moving to a new location on the second floor could create space for more in-depth
reference questions and allow for greater opportunities to collaborate with the
Writing Center and Tutoring Services.
  - There are concerns about whether patrons referred from the Circulation Desk to the
Reference Desk will follow through. There are also concerns about whether
returning patrons will notice our empty space at the first-floor desk, miss the new
directional signage, and assume that the Reference Desk is closed, rather than
located elsewhere.

Overview and Objectives Document
**DISCOVERY & ACQUISITIONS UNIT, 2024-2025**
**Overview:**
The Discovery & Acquisitions unit acquires, maintains, and makes discoverable and accessible through a
wide variety of resources for library patrons. It does so by curating the Library’s general collection,
including print, media, e-resources, and government publications, and by facilitating borrowing and
lending requests from other libraries. To enhance the general collection, unit members review
information about new products, renewals, usage, requests, and costs to make recommendations to
library decision makers. The unit also fulfills patron requests via interlibrary loan, Summit, and
digitization for resources not held by the library itself.
**Library metrics:**
- Electronic Resources (Primary responsibility)
- Physical Circulation (Primary responsibility)
- Resource Sharing (Primary responsibility)
- Course Reserves (Relevant)
- Online Catalog (Relevant)
**Objectives:**
- OBJECTIVE #1: Acquire, activate/process, and maintain accessible general collection resources
in a timely manner.
  - Why:
▪ To provide the university community with accessible, interdisciplinary resources
needed for coursework, research, and lifelong learning.
  - How:
▪ Investigating and communicating resource options to stakeholders.
▪ Accurate and timely orders, invoices, processing, and activations.
▪ Maintenance of discovery systems.
▪ Accepting and processing general collection donations.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Quick acquisition and availability of accessible resources that meet the needs of
the university community.
▪ Easy discoverability of available resources.
  - Fall 2024 Update:

▪ During the fall, the following number of POLs were created: 131 ebooks, 1 e-
journal; 631 physical books; 3 physical journals.
▪ 3,769 items records were added.
▪ The EBSCO ebooks clean-up project resulted in all but 359 ebooks fixed (from an
original 5,000+)
▪ Autoholdings were set up for Elsevier, JSTOR, Project Muse, Ebook Central,
Springer, Taylor and Francis, and Wiley.
▪ The bindery process resulted in 310 (306 periodicals, 6 books) items being sent
to and returned from the bindery.
▪ Processed 277 donated items.
  - Spring 2025 Update:
▪ 179 electronic resources POLs and 1,147 physical resources POLs were created.
▪ 7,121 item records were added.
▪ Quickly addressed a large water leak in the basement, withdrawing damaged
items and shifting to prepare for floor restoration.
▪ Upgraded JSTOR to incorporate 8 new products.
▪ Undertook a big reorganization of the 2nd floor newspapers collection
▪ Began the configuration process for enabling the GOBI API for acquisitions.
▪ Transitioned from Marcive records for government publications to the use of
OCLC’s Worldshare Collection.
▪ Began processing Special Collection’s new Kolln materials.
▪ Checked 131 serial items for holdings accuracy between book storage and
stacks.
▪ Processed 100 donated items.
▪ Provided resource suggestions to the M
▪ arcom team for promotions of library resources in each newsletter.
▪ Development of a Primo analytics dashboard for Discovery Team use to analyze
Primo usage trends.
  - Final Outcomes:
▪ Day-to-day and clean-up operations continued with no major challenges this
year.
▪ Over 10,000 new items were added to the catalog. These include not only new
resources, but also batch added items from collections as well as some
retroactively added government information publications.
▪ New processes were developed, including autoholdings, WEST print serial
withdrawals, and government document record loading.
  - Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
▪ Work with the new GOBI API and the new Rialto/Collecto platform.
▪ Continue withdrawing print serials based on WEST holdings
- OBJECTIVE #2: Continually monitor and assess use of electronic collections and, in conjunction
with Library leadership, strategically manage subscriptions and acquisitions to maximize
return on investment and utility to the university community.
  - Why:
▪ To provide the widest possible range of useful resources in a financially
responsible manner.

  - How:
▪ Gather and analyze cost-per-usage statistics for ongoing electronic resources
▪ Provide projections early in the fiscal year as to what subscriptions are the best
candidates for cancelation at renewal time.
▪ Develop and enact strategy for long-term planning by taking into consideration
multi-year subscriptions.
▪ Gather and analyze request data and purchase requests to identify collection
deficiencies
  - Success looks like:
▪ Accurate and timely review of subscriptions for decision-making purposes.
▪ Low CPU subscriptions.
▪ Staying within budget.
  - Fall 2024 Update:
▪ The unit continued to provide CPU data and FY projects to the Collections Team
for decision making purposes in advance of each team meeting. By the end of
Fall 2024, the team had reduced expected inflation by $57,220 by cancelling
underperforming subscriptions. Work on gathering and analyzing request data
remains to be done.
  - Spring 2025 Update:
▪ The unit continued to provide CPU data and FY projects to the Collections Team
for decision making purposes in advance of each team meeting. By the end of
Spring 2025, the team had reduced expected inflation from an initial projection
of $96,412.85 down to $2,989.10 by identifying $103,694.17 in cancellations.
▪ Initial configurations of COUNTER loads of 5.1 have been set up.
▪ Reharvests of ebook (TR_B1) stats occurred due to concerns about lower than
expected numbers.
  - Final outcomes:
▪ The unit continued to refine reports for the Collections Team, editing, creating,
and sunsetting Analytics reports as needed.
▪ We opted not to continue using Lib Insights due to limited reporting capabilities
with it.
  - Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
▪ The unit will need to adjust reports as needed to account for the updates to
COUNTER 5.1.
▪ The unit still needs to identify processes for analyzing request data in order to
guide decision-making processes.
- OBJECTIVE #3: Continually monitor and assess use of print resources and, in conjunction with
Library leadership, strategically manage approval plan and firm order acquisitions to maximize
return on investment and utility to the university community.
  - Why:

▪ To provide the widest possible range of useful resources in a financially
responsible manner.
  - How:
▪ Gather and analyze circulation and cost statistics for firm and approval
acquisitions
▪ Gather and analyze request data and purchase requests to identify collection
deficiencies
▪ Share CPU and subject trends with selectors.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Accurate and timely review of circulation and cost statistics for decision-making
purposes.
▪ Steady or increasing use of firm and approval plan acquisitions.
▪ Staying within budget.
  - Fall 2024 Update:
▪ The creation of reports with circulation statistics for approval plan items began
in the fall. A general report with all call number ranges was first produced. At
the request of the Collections Team, two additional reports (with loan numbers,
publication date, and receiving date) with individual call number ranges (E and
QC) were produced. Work to create similar reports for firm orders will continue
into Spring 2025 for comparison.
  - Spring 2025 Update:
▪ Approval and firm order circulation reports were combined into a single report
by call number range, both to help with approval plan revisions and to share
with liaisons. The team is heading into summer with plans to make
recommendations by call number for needed changes.
  - Final Outcomes:
▪ This objective was slow to come to fruition this year, but at this point we have a
plan going forward to make recommendations regarding the approval plan.
  - Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
▪ The LRFOT (approvals, reserves, ILL, replacements) went over its allocated
budget in May. Next fiscal year, we will undertake a revision of allocations
based on the Collections Team recommendations for firm orders and approval
plans.
▪ Although we are at a point of making recommendations for the approval plan,
we still need better communication with liaisons and a process for
communicating circulation numbers with them. That said, this may be a
Collections Team, not a unit, issue.
- OBJECTIVE #4: Ensure quick and accurate fulfilment of patron requests for items not currently
held by the library.
  - Why:
▪ To provide patrons with the resources they need for coursework, research, and
lifelong education.

  - How:
▪ Fulfill borrowing and lending ILL, Summit, and digitization requests.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Steady or increasing fill rates.
▪ Steady or decreasing cancellation rates.
▪ Timely communication with patrons when challenges arise.
  - Fall 2024 Update:
▪ A patron satisfaction survey was created and embedded in notification emails
and the Illiad platform. Two responses had been received by the end of the
semester.
▪ Summit fill rates continue to be consistent with previous semesters
▪ ILL lending rates continue to exceed borrowing rates, and appropriate team
members will be meeting with our ILL rep in January to discuss how to adjust
our automated rejection configuration and our fees structure to try and address
this disparity.
  - Spring 2025 Update:
▪ Met with our OCLC Illiad rep to adjust configuration settings, including our fees
structure.
▪ Borrowing rates were higher in the spring than the fall.
▪ Lending requests were 188% higher than borrowing requests.
  - Final Outcomes:
▪ Lending and borrowing rates continued to rebound from their pandemic-slump
five years ago.
▪ Adding in a student worker to ILL was vital in keeping up with increasing
numbers.
  - Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
▪ Hire a new ILL supervisor.
▪ Evaluate whether changes in fees structure had any impact on the number of
lending requests filled.
▪ Rapido implementation!

Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies Unit 2024-25
**Overview**
The Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies unit enriches learning opportunities and
advances research, scholarly and creative activity related to digital scholarship, open
education, open publishing, web development, and asynchronous and online learning.
Serving as the home for programs such as the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning, the
Open Access Publishing Fund, and the Think Open fellowship program, the unit fosters the
infrastructure and expertise necessary to support and sustain the library’s efforts in digital
projects, services, and project management.

**Library KPIs:**
- Digital Collections
- Research Information Management
- Web Properties
- Fellowships (Primary)
- Student Savings
**Objectives:**
Facilitate access to and preservation of unique collections and scholarly
outputs (CDIL, digitization).
- Why:
  - The library has an important responsibility to steward and promote
University of Idaho’s unique collections and scholarship. Since these
resources may not be formally published and are unavailable anywhere else,
the Library serves as a hub to preserve and provide lasting access to users.
- How:
  - Improve digital archive storage to meet NDSA standards for Level 3 digital
preservation.
  - Ensure the public and campus are made aware of new scholarly productions
and digital collections when released.

  - Ensure scholarly outputs and digital collections are easily discoverable,
useable, and accessible.
- Success looks like:
  - Key faculty and staff are conversant with digital preservation standards and
have documented practices to use digital preservation storage.
  - Regular updates promoting new digital collections and scholarly outputs are
sent out via a variety of communication channels, leading to increased
traffic to new content.
  - Web navigation and discovery of digital collection and digital scholarship is
user friendly and meets accessibility guidelines.
- Fall Updates:
  - Unit members have worked with Spec and Digital Collection Team to
facilitate digital preservation processes. We contributed to discussions on
implementing Archive-It service for web archiving and developing policies for
other born digital workflows. Access to the digital archive drive was updated
and better documented. A step by step review based on NSDA standards has
not yet been completed.
  - Some digital collection update and launch workflows were disrupted due to
the departure of key staff over the summer (Klytie and Sarah). Significant
effort went into rewriting all Digital Collections documentation to include
step by step checklists for all processes to help coordinate activities while
onboarding new members (over 50 commits to the documentation in this
period). This has helped clarify work based in CDIL/DSOS vs Spec and
establishes steps to better record data about activities in the unit. Going
forward, our launch checklist is being followed to help improve
communication of new collections and recorded in our tracking spreadsheet
(2 collections completed the checklist this period). Andrew developed a new
digital screen slideshow display for the Library living room area to highlight
new and featured digital collections.
  - This period saw a complete overhaul of the Digital Collection templates and
home page which brought more consistent branding, updated colors, and
useability and accessibility improvements. Complete redeploying of all
collections was necessary to prep the data used for our Search index.
  - We soft-launched our new Search app and deployed search to 111 of 115
eligible digital collections. This represented a huge investment of time for
DSOS with application development, metadata fixes, collection template
updates/fixes, and redeployment. Metadata for about 100 collections and
60,000 records were updated to ensure better consistency in our aggregated

fields. We also improved data about the collections for better reporting. The
work helped grow confidence and skills of CDIL staff which is essential for
ongoing digital collection and website maintenance.
  - DSOS members have been evaluating the impact of new accessibility
requirements and reviewing our existing web properties. In working towards
accessibility goals, we continued a major project to create and deploy
transcripts for all audio/video items in our collections, adding more than 230
new transcripts (only one collection still has any items needing a transcript,
LCOH—transcripts are created but not yet deployed). We have contributed
accessibility updates to Digital Collections, Inside Idaho, Lib Guides, and
Pressbooks (particularly fixing color contrasts and improving alt text).
  - CDIL lab (Kevin) contributed important work on custom digitization requests
that support research on campus and beyond. These often involved obsolete
formats (VHS, reel-to-reel), consulting on process, and quick turn arounds. 7
request projects were recorded for this period.
  - DSOS members have been involved in exploring possibilities for IR, OA/OER,
and data reporting in VERSO. They have helped develop policies and
transferred data for Ag Extension publications and ETD.
- Spring updates:
  - DSOS supported the creation of 6 new digital collections, moving 4 through
the collection launch process (to ensure communication to the public and
internal audiences). Completed maintenance for regularly updated archive
projects such as Mc Clure Center Archive and Friday Letter, and outreach
projects such as Digital Library of Idaho. Restarted IWDL in collaboration
with IWRRI with major redesign and new data.
  - Significant work was done on refining metadata and fixing consistency
issues (which were easier to detect due to the work done on prepping data
for the Search app). Location fields were normalized across dozens of
collections to improve discoverability and usefulness of the data.
  - CDIL lab has worked with students to integrate AI summarization with
human review to speed up metadata creation for large PDF collections.
  - DSOS members and students have worked to enhance existing oral history
transcripts with better copyediting and work on Spanish language materials.
  - DSOS members worked on policy and workflow for creating DOIs for
published digital scholarship and Pressbooks projects.
  - Continued development of Search app, refined workflow for ingest, and
started establishing new self-managed hosting servers.

  - Consulted and helped with web migration and archiving for people impacted
by main University web hosting changes. This has led to some new collection
content such as Michigan Nitrogen Gradient Study.
  - Migrated Library files and content off old webpages server to new locations
(due to IT hosting changes).
Provide collaborative opportunities for learning and project development (e.g.
fellowships programs and collaborative digital scholarship projects) that
impact campus research and teaching.
- Why:
  - The Library’s unique resources and expertise can directly impact scholarship
on campus by opening new research and learning opportunities. This
includes developing OER to impact costs and empower instructors, and
developing digital methods that enable unique research and
communication.
- How:
  - Facilitate Think Open Fellowships.
  - Facilitate CDIL Digital Scholarship student and faculty fellowships.
  - Maintain, develop, and improve digital scholarship on campus through CDIL.
  - Organize campus events for fellows to publicly share projects and
outcomes.
- What success looks like:
  - Fellowship programs receive competitive applications.
  - Fellows publish their projects, present to audiences at the library, and are
promoted online.
  - Publication of 2-3 significant digital scholarship projects.
- Fall updates:
  - CDIL fellowships were prepped for applications in Spring. Data about
fellowships was gathered to prepare for a more centralized representation of
the work and outputs.
  - DSOS/CDIL hosted the Library Fellowship Showcase in October with three
fellows presenting. DSOS members have taken an active role in facilitating
the MRIC presentations move into the Library (including weekly work from
Kevin to assemble and deploy an A/V setup).
  - DSOS has collaborated on a wide variety of digital scholarship projects with
faculty and students. We provided ongoing support to Spec, CDIL, and Think

Open fellows’ projects (more than 5 during this period). Outputs published in
**Fall 2024 include:**
▪ School of Cello Playing, Mirada Wilson (Music, faculty) - translation
project with Evan Williamson, published on Pressbooks.
▪ Basic Financial Education Curriculum for Students, Upal Kundu and
Udit Sipani (ASUI, undergraduates) - literacy project with Leesa Love,
published on Pressbooks.
▪ Aural Skills, Miranda Wilson (Music, faculty) - open textbook
converted to Pressbooks project for potential reuse.
▪ The Cook Undergraduate Research Journal (CURJ), with Markie
Mc Brayer and Florian Justwan (Political Science, faculty) -
undergraduate research journal project.
▪ Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Technology Collection, final publishing of
long grant funded scholarship project, with significant custom
features.
  - DSOS members also did significant consultations with researchers across
campus, reporting over 12 meetings during the fall semester. We taught over
10 public workshops / class sessions related to our area.
- Spring updates:
  - Continued extensive collaboration and consultation around digital
**scholarship projects, including:**
▪ Context Podcast Digital Collection, collaborating with Idaho
Humanities Council, an archive of podcasts.
▪ Taylor Wilderness Research Station Archive, a variety of collaborators
from Taylor, Confluence Lab, and CDIL to complete a complex
archive of documents, research, artifacts, and oral histories.
▪ Martin Journal, collaborating with Martin Institute, migrating from
main university website to library hosting, and establishing new
journal home page.
▪ Moscow High School Archaeology, Massey Jordan and Kat Eichner
(Anthropology), public outreach project highlighting work done at
MHS and the stories artifacts can tell.
▪ Tender Spaces, Alicia Gladman (English), completed CDIL fellowship
project featuring oral history braided narrative.
▪ Travelers in Egypt, Matthew Strupp and Sarah Ketchley (Uof W MLIS),
consulted on collection with objects hosted by Internet Archive.
▪ Chinese American Heritage in Idaho, Matt Fuerst (Anthropology),
resources for Chinese American Heritage in Idaho Teaching Trunk.

  - Selected CDIL fellows for 2025. We had 12 complete graduate applications,
4 complete undergrad applications, and 1 faculty development application
coming from 9 different programs across campus. Both groups were highly
competitive with several truly excellent applications. Applications were
reviewed by a committee, and we selected a grad, undergrad, and faculty
development fellow who have started work for summer 2025.
  - Hosted CDIL Digital Scholarship Camp for fellows and librarians to
collaboratively learn about the web, digital exhibits, and digital scholarship.
Facilitate social and technical infrastructure for open publishing both on
campus and worldwide (OAPF, web development, Pressbooks).
- Why:
  - The Library invests in the future of publishing beyond traditional subscription
models, supporting and developing alternative open publishing
opportunities to increase access to knowledge.
- How:
  - Pressbooks platform and service is promoted, documented, and maintained
for campus users.
  - Open Access Publishing Fund is managed to directly support open
publishing for U of I researchers.
  - Collection Builder and related approaches are developed and promoted for
sustainable web projects.
  - Meetings and events are hosted that promote Digital Scholarship and Open
scholarship collaboration on campus.
- What success looks like:
  - Use of Pressbooks to create OER and other projects increases.
  - Metrics for OAPF continue to show impact supporting open publishing.
  - Collection Builder continues to get engagement beyond campus.
- Fall updates:
  - The Pressbooks home was revised to improve presentation and catalog
consistency. Leesa has worked on documenting best practices for
Pressbook service and growing our capacity to support projects. She has
developed Pressbooks templates, covers, draft policies, project
management document template, and better data for tracking projects. 2
new Pressbooks projects were published (listed above section), and 2

additional projects created. Additionally, 5 Pressbooks were added to the
Library’s main catalog and VERSO, and 4 were promoted.
  - OAPF continued as normal, closing in period #1 early with high demand.
Leesa took over leadership of the program and everything went smoothly.
  - Collection Builder opened applications for the second round of the LIS
Student Program and received over 70 applications from 25 different
schools. The CB blog and Slack have seen increased engagement. CB team
has collaborated on a number of projects beyond campus, including:
▪ Lauren Mc Cormick (grad, Princeton University), Judean Pillar Figurine
Exhibit, "Let There Be Light: Recoloring Ancient Artifacts",
https://laurmcco.github.io/judeanpillarfigurineexhibit/
- Spring updates:
  - OAPF period #2 closed as normal, successfully spending out FY25 funding.
  - Several new projects have started in Pressbooks and new contacts
expressing interest.
  - Collection Builder IMLS grant was terminated, ending funding. However, LIS
Student program continued with 12 students (several dropped out after
funding cut disruption). CB Digital Librarian Cohort program received 35
quality applications from 34 institutions. After funding was cut, 6 librarians
decided to join the cohort without funding. CB team members presented at a
conference and taught a week long course at DHSI. Major updates were
added to the templates, including a new About page layout and advanced
search features on Browse—these features are driven by our digital
scholarship projects on campus and are refined for reuse to enhance the
public templates. Consulted on a variety of external projects, including
Michael Aronson’s Historic Theaters project.
  - Established a new Open Journals System instance for hosting journals at
domain “journals.lib.uidaho.edu”. Initially set up for the Fire Lookout
Journal, but will be available for other future projects.

Final Outcomes 2024-25
After significant personnel changes in the previous year, 2024-25 saw DSOS add a new
faculty member (Leesa Love filling the newly designed Open Publishing Librarian position)
and new staff member (Maryelizabeth Koepele, filling Digital Projects Manager position).
Personnel activity was also impacted by the unavoidable extended absence of one of our
faculty members. The previous year saw huge change in our digital infrastructure, which
also impacted our activities in 2024-25, with new national requirements (accessibility rules
update), IT mandated changes (webpages hosting changes and main university web
redesign), and Library initiatives (Digital Collections Search app and metadata
aggregation). DSOS has flexibly adapted to continue making progress on our objectives
while growing internal skills to sustain our projects.
**Reflection on 2024-25 objectives:**

- Facilitate access to and preservation of unique collections and scholarly outputs –
the unit made key improvements to better communicate about our collections and
make them more discoverable.
  - Improved workflow for launching new collections and recording data about
the processes.
  - Rebranding and improved navigation of Digital Collections area of the Library
website, clarifying the purpose and scope of the collections.
  - Launch of new Digital Collections Search that centralizes full text search of
all digital collection content, and continued development and refinement of
the application. Work also included significant enhancement of digital
collection metadata to improve the consistency and value of the aggregated
data.
  - Accessibility improvements, including text transcripts for all audio and video
collection items, to enhance useability for all people.
  - Direct collaboration with others across campus to help develop alternative
hosting of unique content impacted by IT mandated changes to hosting on
their main website and old webpages server.
  - Although work was done on our digital archive drive (improving
documentation, discussion of NDSA standards, exploration of new more
extensible hardware to meet growing storage needs), we did not complete a
formal assessment following NDSA and will carry that goal forward to next
year.
- Provide collaborative opportunities for learning and project development (e.g.
fellowships programs and collaborative digital scholarship projects) that impact
campus research and teaching – the unit did significant collaboration with faculty
and students across campus to create and publish unique scholarship and build
skills.
  - CDIL published above the targeted number of unique projects with fellows
and others on campus, building strong collaborations which led to unique
scholarship that is openly shared. The Think Open Fellowship was closed,
although work continued on several projects.
  - New publishing opportunities have opened up with Pressbooks and student
“journals” hosted with the library.
  - CDIL hosted one successful public presentation event, contributed to
workshops, MRIC, and a fellows training event.
- Facilitate social and technical infrastructure for open publishing both on campus
and worldwide – the unit continues to develop support for open publishing and
digital scholarship that impact campus and beyond.

  - OAPF continues to see demand and successfully spent out the funding.
  - Pressbooks service was improved and has started to gain traction on
campus. An OJS instance was started to support potential journal
publishing.
  - Collection Builder continues to have worldwide engagement, while enabling
our local digital scholarship projects. The termination of grant funding will
limit future travel and outreach opportunities, but will not hamper continuing
development.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
The current objectives seem to still embody meaningful goals for DSOS going into 2025-26,
with slight tweaks to the specifics listed in “how” sections. Here are some challenges and
opportunities that will impact our work next year:
- Updates to Title II ADA requirements for web accessibility: new rules which come
into effect in 2026 have led to a lot of confusion and challenges in digital libraries.
We have already done significant work evaluating and improving digital collections
and other resources to meet the requirements. However, further challenges may
remain as details of the ruling become clearer. We will need to devote time to
evaluating potential issues, reprocessing PDF files, and remediating older areas of
our web content.
- Rethinking Think Open: with the Open area at full strength, some changes in
statewide mandates, and growing capacity with publishing, we have an opportunity
to reshape the Think Open Fellowship program and area. We anticipate CDIL
making support for open publishing and OER more explicitly part of our “digital
scholarship” activities. We hope to build more capacity for open digital publishing
in the library with DOIs, communication, and discoverability that can support
scholarly communication on campus.
- Lack of grant funding for Collection Builder: with IMLS and NEH grants being
terminated and new funding unlikely to arise, we will have less money to support
travel and outreach for Collection Builder, and less salary funds paid to the library
from contributions to other external grant projects. This will reduce our flexibility
and require careful thought about how to allocate limited resources. Faculty may
need to explore new alternative funding and networking opportunties.

The Research & Experiential Learning (REL) offers dedicated spaces and services to U of I
students, staff, and faculty to engage in curricular, research, or personal learning experiences.
The REL Unit delivers services through four programs: the MILL, the Studio, the Data Hub, and
VERSO. Unit personnel emphasizes excellence in service delivery, creative and innovative
learning opportunities, and efficient management of its resources in support of the Library’s
strategic priorities.
**Library KPIs:**
- Geographic Information Systems
  - Usage via unique logins, # of items created, collections purchased
- Research Information Management
  - Records added via Smart Harvesting, Deposits, Other
- Building Usage
  - Space usage in Data Hub, Studio Bookings, MILL Door Counts
- Research and Reference Assistance
  - Questions answered in Lib Answers
- Workshops and Presentations
  - Tech Talks
  - MILL Workshops
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Maximize user engagement with program equipment and services
- Why:
  - To facilitate student and patron use of Library resources effectively
- How:
  - Providing spaces that allow students to engage in experiential learning
activities, including using MILL equipment, Studio equipment, and Data Hub
equipment.
  - Providing state of the art tools that enable research and academic work in
making, rapid prototyping, audio/visual production, and GIS/data-intensive
computing.
  - Providing trained, educated personnel to answer queries and provide support
for using the tools and equipment.
  - Promoting the spaces, tools, and personnel offered across campus
- Success looks like:
  - Usage metrics that meet or exceed previous performance
  - Qualitative data that indicates patron satisfaction with resources
- Fall Update

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
  - MILL door counts exhibited an increase from 12650 in Fall 2024 vs. 9986 in Fall
2023. Annually, 2024 had higher door counts than 2023.
  - Data Hub space usage (numbers of people observed during staffed times) was at
its peak in Fall 2024 with an average of 9.3 people per day, up from 8.2 people in
Fall 2023. The desk saw 79 questions asked, compared to 34 the previous Fall
semester.
  - Studio bookings were 141, which is down from 228 in Spring 24, but up from 104
in the Fall 23. We suspect a cyclical pattern with high spring usage and lower fall
usage. Likewise, the hours the Studio was in use per week was 13, up from
10.75 in Fall 23, but down from Spring 24, which was 22.9 hours per week.
- Spring Update1:
  - MILL door counts were slightly down from Fall 2024 (12650 people) to 11532 in
Spring 2025. However, the Spring 2025 numbers were up from the previous
Spring 2024 (8649) or Spring 2023 (9978).
  - Data Hub space usage was consistent with the Fall 2024. In spring 2025, we
recorded approximately 10 people per day on average during our staffed shifts
(not including event participation). This is very modestly improved on Fall 2024
(9.3), and greatly improved on Spring 2024 (6.7). Interestingly, the Access
Services review of the space (recorded differently than us) yielded about 217.6
people per month, which when measured similarly is pretty consistent. The desk
saw 33 questions, compared to the previous Spring 2024 of 45 questions.
  - Studio bookings were 213, which is down from 228 in Spring 24, but up from 141
in the Fall 24. The hours the Studio was in use per week was 21, up from 13 in
Fall 24, but down from Spring 24, which was 22.9 hours per week.
Create effective learning and research experiences
- Why:
  - To advance information and digital literacy while improving student and
patron capacity to utilize a range of tools
- How:
  - Producing instructional resources that allow asynchronous learning
  - Developing workshops and learning events led by experts
  - Providing services that support the curriculum directly
  - Promoting the resources, workshops, events, and services offered across
campus
- Success looks like:
  - Consistent, well-attended workshops and events
  - Course/class engagement with REL programs
  - Research lab/group engagement with REL programs
- Fall Update
1 I edited the Fall 2024 Data Hub numbers to be our “Avg People w/o events” count of 9.3, which is
different than the previously reported number of 12, which was the Fall 2024 “Avg People w/ events”. This
is because we started counting differently in 2025 and the Avg People w/ Events number is discontinued,
so there is now no comparison. Now the Fall and Spring use the same number.

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
  - Data Hub Tech Talks declined this semester, both in numbers of talks given
and in terms of attendance vs. Spring 2024.
  - MILL Workshops exhibited a decline in overall attendees from the of Fall
2023, but an increase in attendance vs the spring 2024. The trend of annual
attendance (spring + fall) is still increasing.
  - Course and class engagement continued.
▪ The Data Hub continued to be used by VTD 254, scheduled almost
weekly throughout the semester. ENVS 497 and GEOG 385 had students
visit us for help.
▪ The MILL has several classes that work with it, including GERM 301,
FOR 274, SPAN 306, and several campus groups.
▪ The Studio engaged the School of Music directly, receiving feedback for
enhancing the space for their use and is used frequently for coursework.
- Spring Update:
  - Data Hub Tech Talks were held similarly with the Fall 2024, with 5 talks.
Total, mean, and median attendees were down slightly from 43/8.6/7 to
38/7.6/5 respectively.
  - MILL workshops grew in both number and attendance in Spring 2025, with
168 attendees in Spring 2025 vs. 136 in Fall 2024 or 98 in Spring 2024. This
is partly due to 2 more workshops than the previous two semesters. Average
attendance was about 18.6 in Spring 2025, compared to 19.4 in Fall 2024
and 14 in Spring 2024.
  - Course and Class engagement continued:
▪ Studio: About half of the bookings were class-related. The School of
Music faculty have also requested new software (Logic Pro) installed and
reserved the space for class use. For example, Prof. Dylan Champagne
and Prof. Corbin Hohstadt have reserved the space 12 and one time,
respectively.
▪ The MILL interacts with several classes, including GERM 301, SOC404,
SPAN 409 and several campus groups and individual students.
▪ The Data Hub was used by VTD 254 again repeatedly throughout the
semester. IIDS began using the Data Hub frequently for its various
gatherings and brown bags. The Computer Science department began to
use the Data Hub as a location to deliver its CSAC – computer science
course assistance.
Manage research information and data collections efficiently and effectively
- Why:
  - To support university and library goals of tracking and promoting university-
generated research outputs
  - To provide long-term, persistent, public archival support for university research
information, including data and document deposits
- How:
  - Provide support for research data management through data management plan
assistance

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
  - Provide support for geospatial resources and services through the management
of Arc GIS resources and platforms
  - Manage information streams through Esploro/VERSO
  - Work with the DSOS Unit and relevant teams to ensure the repository functions
of Esploro/VERSO function well
- Success looks like:
  - Continued high use of Arc GIS platforms
  - Consistent updating of VERSO
  - Engagement by at least one unit from each UI College with VERSO
  - Use of data management support meeting or exceeding previous performance
- Fall Update
  - GIS platforms continue to exhibit strong use patterns. Fall 2024 (August-
December) unique users averaged 492 per month vs. 422 per month in Fall
2023.
  - VERSO was continually updated throughout the fall, with Research Impacts
Team members managing smart harvesting and the acquisition of several larger
collections of content, namely UI Extension bulletins and the RCDS data
repository.
  - Based on Analytics reports (Esploro Updates - 2024), there is widespread
updating of profile information. The reports make it difficult to verify but virtually
all colleges appear to represented there.
  - Data management support (in the form of DMP consultations was down in 2024
from 2023), however, there appeared to be more RDM-related questions at the
Data Hub than in previous semesters.
- Spring Update:
  - GIS platforms are doing well. We saw approx. 552 unique users per month in
Spring 2025 compared to 492 per month in Fall 2024 or 443 per month in Spring
2024.
  - VERSO was continually updated throughout the spring. The RCDS data
collection was completed in Spring 2025 and regular updates and patron
deposits continued to occur.
  - Data management support continued on the same lines as the Fall 2024, with
about 3 formal consultations.
Revamp the “License to MILL” program (2024-2025 project)
- Why:
  - To create a system of validation/credentialing for students that have
learned how to use various MILL equipment
- How:
  - Refresh the tracking document for the current MILL equipment and
services
  - Establish a tracking tool internally for the MILL manager
- Success Looks Like:
  - A small number of students starting the program each semester
  - 100% completion by a subset of those students

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
  - Promotion of achievement through the MILL’s communication channels
- Fall Update
  - The MILL Manager has started to outline the new achievements for the
License to MILL program. We have not yet formalized the changes yet.
- Spring Update
  - The tracking document has been revamped/refreshed with updated
information for the current capabilities of the MILL. Likewise, the tracking
tool for internal use is prepared. We should be ready for the program in
the Fall 2025.

**Final Outcomes**
In all, 2024-2025 was a year of transition for multiple programs within REL. The MILL’s
renovation was completed in the Fall and set up a great year with traffic up in this year, far
beyond the 2023-2024 academic year. Workshops were also improved with an increase in
workshops and an increase in attendance, including new records. The Studio followed suit with
a major renovation – still ongoing – and a move to the first floor. We have initiated some new
partnerships with Music, longer hours, and have new software and new resources available to
students. We’ve seen bookings keep their pattern of higher in the Spring than the Fall, but with
a minor decline against the previous year. We feel the completion of the renovation might help
change that.
The Data Hub also saw mixed results, with an increase in general space usage, especially
studying and research-related use. However, we’ve seen a decrease in questions asked – with
some regular patrons shifting to individual consultation after coming to the desk, and a decrease
in the attendance of the Tech Talks. Both will require reflection for the next year. GIS platform
and collection use continues to be strong, with higher unique users counts than the previous
year. Finally, the VERSO program has had its first full year in production, with a permanent
Research Information Coordinator in place throughout the year. The results are difficult to judge
as there are not prior years against which to compare, but we achieved our goals and projects
for adding and improving content in the system and the result is a more robust institutional
repository than a year ago.
**Accomplishments include:**
- More than 50% of patrons to the MILL require assistance and the MILL has over 1500
recorded visitors per semester (using our sign-in sheet). MILL staff and students handled
each and every request for help.
- The Mobile MILL has never been more successful at reaching out to students through
events. REL staff and faculty also successfully shared success with the Mobile MILL in
an international conference.
- The MILL directly supported a number of class and research projects. We also continued
our partnership with the Fortunato Lab to 3D print nontoxic parts that can be used in wet
laboratory experiments. We worked with a CNR team to create plot flags for use in the

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
Arboretum. Students produced exhibit material for art shows, created replicas of real-
world objects like the Chernobyl dome, and resources for hydroponics projects.
- Successful re-envisioning of the Studio by library faculty. We made clear choices
regarding items to keep and grow – podcasting facilities – and items to remove – the
e Glass equipment. While not yet complete, our traffic is on par with previous semesters.
- Successfully formed a partnership with Music to build the Studio’s support for their
Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) courses.
- The Data Hub combined with the Computer Science Assistance Center (CSAC) this
year. This involved the introduction of staff and student work space and equipment, as
well as new signage in the library.
- Successfully built a relationship with IIDS to host more of their networking, fellows, and
AI events in the Data Hub space.
- VERSO collections have grown. We have successfully added the current UI Extension
documents and taken over the data repository role from ORED and imported their
previous collection.
- VERSO profiles and metadata are also more robust. We have successfully cleaned and
improved profiles from every college and research unit in the university and are
successfully managing the flow of deposits from researchers and harvest from our
automated harvesters.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
**Challenges:**
- The current Studio space lacks substantial soundproofing, which has resulted in
occasional noise leakage. In some instances, patrons playing loud music prompted
noise complaints from nearby areas. To mitigate this, we needed to develop a stronger
response to both recording noise complaints and enforcing the rules, which entails
documenting the issues and contacting the offending patrons. Thus far, it appears to be
working.
- In all three patron-facing programs, there are continuing challenges in reaching out to
faculty, building relationships, and growing volume of the service. In each case, we have
several programs that work with us, but the potential ceiling (how many partnerships we
have) is much higher than we have likely been able to attain.
- The Data Hub, specifically, hasn’t been able to grow its question base consistently. We
have ebbs and flows, without strong or consistent engagement. While other libraries
have similar services, it is tough to know what the necessary factors are that we are
possibly missing. For the staff who work the desk, the question is whether working a shift
diminishes productivity. If so, we may need to rethink the time spent on the desk.
- The Tech Talks have proven to be a tough nut to crack. We have seen talk attendance
be inconsistent, but also willingness to give talks. The only consistent thread is AI tech
talks have been popular. Remains to be seen what the best approach is.
**Opportunities:**

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
- The completion of the Studio’s renovation promises to enable a wide range of services
depending on patron interest. With significant investment, we will have made a much
better podcasting and audio production facility than elsewhere on campus. There is
tremendous opportunity to turn this into a high-volume service.
- The growth and adjustment of our staff and faculty’s activities in support of REL
programs offer opportunities as well. Everyone in the unit will have been in place for over
a year, each unit will be supported by multiple personnel, and they know their areas of
responsibility and will be prepared to deliver for the unit.
- MILL workshops have not been formally documented and their learning outcomes not
yet tied to library literacies or other broader outcomes. We have created some resources
to begin this process and will result in improved pedagogical support for workshop
activities.
- We have seen a few examples of students benefitting from our PCs in the Data Hub,
especially to train geoprocessing models requiring the hardware of the PC. These often
can take days and the students have few other options. This may be an area of growth.
- With the “License to MILL” program ready – we have an opportunity to revisit gamify-ing
the process of learning creative technology skills. While we will need to market the
program, it may be an area of positive engagement with students.

Special Collections and Archives Department
Overview: The Special Collections and Archives (Spec) department supports stakeholder access
to unique and rare materials that are crucial to studying the history of the university, the state,
and the region. A significant portion of Spec’s holdings are not duplicated anywhere else in the
world, and the archives are curated to serve the needs of students, faculty, and the community.
Users of Spec holdings apply their findings to scholarly research projects, industry-driven
inquiries, university storytelling efforts, personal or family studies, and more.

Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
1. Curate collections that are unique and useful to patrons
- Why: Patrons to Spec are best served by collections that are thoughtfully arranged, are
related to the department’s collecting priorities, and are comprised of materials that are
not redundant to other repositories
- How: Bring intentionality to each step of the curatorial process – from donation
acceptance to weeding to arrangement; cultivate donations of materials that are unique
and compliment other holdings in the archives; use patron feedback and collection usage
data to make informed choices about what to collect in the future
- Success looks like: Developing a more detailed scope of collections that empowers
members of Spec to make decisions during processing that support departmental,
Library, and university priorities; the ability to connect patron inquiries to relevant
collection resources in Spec
- Fall Update: Over the fall semester, Spec acquired several notable collections as well as
a broad variety of materials that add to the strengths of our archive. The Kolln book
collection, that consisted of more than 1,000 volumes, is a remarkable assemblage of
books written by and about American women. For scholars of women’s history, it will be a
significant asset once fully catalogued. We partnered with the National Forest Service to
save nearly 10,000 historic images from the Kooskia Ranger Station from destruction.
Several extension offices have asked us to take possession of important records related
to 4-H and other programs organized through the University of Idaho. We added almost
100 linear feet in new accessions between Aug. 15 and the end of December.
- Spring Update: Our department continued to add meaningful collections to the Library
archives throughout the semester. One major focus of our efforts was gathering materials
from offices that were forced to close in January due to changing state rules around
diversity programs. Both physical and digital materials were gathered from now-shuttered
offices like the Women’s Center and the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Another time-
sensitive collecting initiative involved archiving U of I web properties that are likely to be
cut from the University’s website during a forthcoming redesign. The Library purchased a
subscription to Archive It in order to document webpages quickly and securely. Between
December and June, Rebecca archived 167MB of data. The process for turning that

material into accessible public-facing items is under development. Most of our collecting
in Spring ‘25 was in service to documenting University history.
2. Make collections easy to find and use
- Why: Our work is only meaningful when patrons can engage with it. Barriers to accessing
archival information should be dismantled where possible.
- How: Invest time and energy into processing collections with robust finding aids, then
sharing those via Archives West; commitment to good customer service and helping
patrons to the best of our abilities; collaborate with colleagues across the Library to think
creatively about expanding digital access to archival materials
- Success looks like: Processing all new accessions measuring less than 3 cubic feet
before shelving; devote student staff and regular staff time to processing backlog
accessions; publishing new finding aids and making updates to existing finding aids;
working closely with the Digital Collections Team to make Spec materials available online
- Fall Update: We continue to make significant progress on processing our backlogged
material. The majority of recent donations have been processed quickly, and at least one
large legacy donation was finally cataloged in the fall. A major benefit of processing older
accessions is the reduction in size of their footprint. The Lauren Fins donation, which was
originally acquired in 2008 and totaled more than 40 boxes was reduced by nearly 50%.
Over the course of the semester 70 new finding aids were added, representing newly
accessible material, and another 14 were updated for increased usability. A major effort
this fall involved creating finding aids for book collections that were otherwise absent
from Archives West, the platform we are most often directing patrons to use.
- Spring Update: During the spring, with the help of student workers and a fully staffed
department, we added 78 more finding aids to Archives West and updated more than 40
more. Many of those new finding aids reflected very recently acquired materials. We are
making good progress on decreasing lag time between donation acceptance and public
access. A few examples of complex donations that were quickly processed include a
collection of more than 1,000 political campaign buttons as well as a large set of letters
belonging to a Vandal alumnus (MA2025-03/MG 660 and MA2025-15/MG666,
respectively).
3. Demonstrate the importance of archiving and the relevance of our collections
- Why: Potential users of the archive are more likely to engage with materials if they
understand their importance and the basic principles of archiving (a.k.a. archival
intelligence)

- How: Offer instruction for students and community members; participate in workshops
both on and off campus; create displays using archival materials; publish writing in public-
facing mediums about archiving or archival materials in our collection
- Success looks like: Build and maintain relationships with faculty who integrate archival
instruction into their course; pursue outreach opportunities to connect with the campus
community and beyond; develop topical displays and write articles that highlight parts of
our collections
- Fall Update: We created two new displays during the fall to highlight archival material –
one on the Library’s 2nd floor and one in the University house. We once again provided
printed materials for the university’s Veterans Day dinner. Four more pieces were
submitted to the Moscow-Pullman Daily News for their “Nearby History” column. The
ETIL workshops led by Dulce and Kelley both highlighted the importance of archival
material, and a Graduate Student Essentials workshop also focused on archival
resources. There were 6 classroom instruction sessions offered.
- Spring Update: In a variety of ways, faculty and staff in Spec promoted the value of the
Library’s special collections and more broadly the relevance of historical primary sources.
ETIL workshops led by all three of the department’s faculty focused on archival or primary
source topics. Six classroom instruction sessions touched students in the History,
English, and Math departments. Another four profiles of U of I archival material were
carried by the local newspaper. Ten new posts were added to the Harvester blog. The
department collaborated with the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival for a display of materials
belonging to Leonard Feather, located on the Library’s second floor. Dulce took on
leadership roles in two interdisciplinary efforts – one to see the Moscow campus
designated on the NRHP and one to coordinate America250 commemorations at the
university. Both opportunities will provide venues to highlight the Library’s unique
historical collections. Lastly, the sudden closure of long-standing campus offices brought
the value of historic records to the forefront of many people’s minds. It was beneficial that
Spec had a standing relationship with some of those offices, and a reputation for good
work that made it easy to connect with those who had not interacted with our office in the
past.
Additional Reflection: Objective 1 calls for us to “use patron feedback and collection usage data
to make informed choices about what to collect in the future,” while Objective 2 calls for a
“commitment to good customer service and helping patrons to the best of our abilities.” In
service to these two objectives, we used AI to mine the data we collect in our Patron Support
Report form. Spec faculty and staff use the form to report on their interactions with patrons, and
the Reading Room interactions our student staff have are input into the form as well.
Here is comprehensive analysis: AI Analysis of Patron Interactions.docx

The key takeaways that are most useful to consider moving into the next year are as follows.
- Metadata accuracy: the highly varied, user-supplied collection labels argue for
tightening controlled vocabulary in the inquiry form (auto-suggest or drop-downs) to
reduce ambiguity.
- Outreach: with scholarly researchers, genealogists, and students comprising most
activity, tailored online guides for those segments could reduce reference e-mail
volume and speed triage.
Final Outcomes: The biggest measurable achievements of the Spec department over the last
year include the number of new finding aids added to Archives West, the number of new
donations we accepted and processed, and the number of patrons we served with a wide variety
of needs. Important efforts were made to better organize our archival storage so that like
materials were housed together. Student staff were trained and managed to increase our
processing productivity as well as maintain robust public hours in the Reading Room. New
investments in digital archiving allowed for important acquisitions and the ability to respond
quickly to the needs of campus partners.
The most important achievement of the department, however, is more difficult to measure. As a
group of faculty and staff, we have developed strong working relationships that support
collaboration and collegiality. There is open communication which makes problem solving not
just routine but enjoyable. The trust and respect that is being built in Spec makes it easier to
tackle long-standing challenges and approach projects with enthusiasm and a plan.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year: A recent report from the state’s insurance
provider outlined some significant changes that need to be made to our physical storage spaces
within the next several months. This will take teamwork, both to find a solution to the identified
problems and physically because of the volume of shifting that will need to take place. Space –
how much we have, how we use it, and how we can augment it to make it safer for our collections
– continues to be one of the biggest challenges we face in Spec.
A great deal of work has been completed over the last year to establish how we preserve and
access digital archival material, and that should be counted as an accomplishment. As we wrap
up our second year of having a full-time Digital Archivist (and Rebecca marks one year on the job),
we have opportunities to refine our collecting and management protocols for born-digital
materials. We also have an obligation to consider how to integrate AI tools into our department’s
work. Having a representative on the Library’s AI working group/team will help us meet that
obligation.

TEAMS

ATS Team, Academic Year 2024-2025
Last updated 6/16/2025
**Overview:**
The ATS Team coordinates work between the access and technical services units of the library to ensure
resources are available to patrons in a timely fashion and that the library’s catalog accurately reflects
what is on the shelves.
**Relevant Library KPIs:**
- Course reserves
- Electronic resources
- Online catalog
- Physical circulation
**Objectives:**
**● Objective #1:**
  - Ensure optimal workflows between access and technical services activities
  - Why:
▪ To ensure patrons have timely access to needed materials
▪ To ensure accuracy between the library’s catalog and the library’s shelves.
  - How:
▪ Coordinate steps between processing and shelving new materials.
▪ Coordinate training and supervision of student employees performing ATS and
mailroom tasks.
▪ Coordinate the withdrawal/catalog deletion of withdrawn physical materials.
▪ Coordinate activities for the relocation/re-cataloging of any physical material
collections.
▪ Coordinates searches for lost and missing items and ensure catalog reflects
most current status.
▪ Regularly review “in transit” items.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Quick turnaround between material arrival and shelving.
▪ Limited errors in cataloging and availability of materials on shelves.
▪ Limited “in transit” for longer than 30 days.
**Fall Update:**

**● Metrics:**
  - # of new physical materials received/shelved
▪ 1322 periodical issues
▪ 714 books/serials
  - # of physical materials withdrawn
▪ 1315 item records deleted
  - # of lost and missing items:
▪ Lost Status: 661
▪ Missing Status: 674
**Access Services:**
- This Fall Aarika extensively searched for lost and missing books, even going so far as to bring in a
video camera that could look between the shelving units! We are due for another extensive
search this March over spring recess. Haley has done an exceptional job this Fall, training
students in mending and newspaper processing. She trained 4 students in mending and 5 in
how to process papers. This has had a significant impact on the turnaround time for both
workloads. There are still a few outliers on the “in transit” status, but I have been able to
notably reign it in and mostly determine where and why we were having so many long-term
issues.
**Technical Services:**
- Standard procedure continued unabated in Fall 2024, with additions and withdrawals
proceeding as usual. Abby Kirkham, Rachel Kerr, and Clinton Johnson spearheaded a digitization
effort of 20 different regional newspapers requested by Ancestry that included hundreds of rolls
of microfilm being shipped out and reshelved upon return. Matthew Strupp began the process
of aiding the Herbarium in copy cataloguing their Botanical Library for ease of access. Samantha
Thompson-Franklin and Clinton worked to set up an Evidence Based Acquisition e Book plan with
IGI Global.
**Spring Update:**
**● Metrics:**
  - # of new physical materials received/shelved
▪ 1575 periodical issues
▪ 1029 books/serials
  - # of physical materials withdrawn
▪ 1401 item records deleted Spring 2025
- An additional 4950 volumes were withdrawn during Fall/Spring 24/25
that did not have item records to account for in Analytics
  - # of lost and missing items:
▪ Lost Status: 554
▪ Missing Status: 686

**Access Services:**
- The students that trained in the Fall for mail room tasks (papers, periodicals, donations and
mending) have done an exceptional job managing the workflow. Our “lost” items were down by
over 100 from Fall to Spring and our “missing” materials only increased by 12. We are still
working to determine why some materials are in a prolonged “in-transit” status and Lex has
volunteered to track the issues on a more frequent basis going forward.
**Technical Services:**
- This Spring saw the continuation of the cataloguing work Matthew has been doing for the
Herbarium, as well as a new project processing an initial batch of titles for the new SPEC Kolln
Collection of books by and about women. Rachel Kerr continued withdrawals in accordance
with the needs of the WEST Archive and continued the work of withdrawing targeted periodicals
on 2nd to coincide with the ongoing space optimization analysis. Additionally, Rachel and Clinton
aided in the emergency relocation and withdrawal of materials affected by the Spring flooding
incident in the basement. IGI Global EBA e Books plan reached its conclusion with the addition
of 28 new e Book titles.
**Final Outcomes:**
- AY 24-25 proved to be very successful in satisfying our Teams objective of optimizing workflow
between Access Services and Technical Services. The additional use of our students in the
mailroom was our most prominent success. We no longer have donations, periodicals and
papers piling up for days and not making it onto the shelves for weeks. We now have a daily
turnover for these materials. Lost, missing and In-transit materials stayed fairly stable
throughout the year which is also a positive and indicative that our processing, and handling of
materials is functioning well.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
Hiring a new lead and implementing Rapido in ILL will present both a challenge and a wealth of
opportunity for their unit. Access Services plans to reinvigorate the lost/missing/in-transit workflows in
hopes to determine a more meaningful metric for tracking in the coming year. Fall 2025 should see the
completion of the bulk of the Herbarium Botanical Library copy cataloging project. Technical services
would be happy to assist should the Herbarium require additional copy cataloging for new materials.

**COLLECTIONS TEAM, 2024-2025**
**Overview:**
The Collections Team is responsible for leading the development of the Library’s general collections,
which includes working in conjunction with subject liaisons and ensuring existing collections budgets are
being spent efficiently. They ensure the campus community is able to provide feedback on the Library’s
collections and investigate new opportunities for resource acquisitions.
**Library KPIs:**
- Relevant
- Course Reserves
- Electronic Resources
- Online Catalog
- Physical Circulation
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Review the library’s existing general collection resources and analyze usage
- Why:
  - To maximize university investments through the library and responsibly steward
university resources
- How:
  - Identify and analyze overlapping subscriptions in our existing collections.
  - Identify potential new subscriptions aligned with the library’s collection development
goals.
  - Create, maintain, and analyze circulation reports for both approval plan and firm order
acquisitions.
- Success Looks Like:
  - Recommendations given based on analyzing a selection of our existing collection
  - Recommendations given on new subscriptions throughout the year
  - Reports shared with selectors and recommendations given on those reports
- Fall Update
  - On a monthly basis, usage statistics were reviewed of every collection due for renewal
in 1-2 months. Recommendations were made to the Dean for renewal or cancellation
per that discussion. We have made progress developing circulation reports for our
approval plan and firm order titles, with a goal of producing reports to enable liaisons to
make adjustments to their spending or to the approval plan.
- Spring Update
  - On a monthly basis, usage statistics were reviewed of every collection due for renewal
in 1-2 months. Recommendations were made to the Dean for renewal or cancellation
per that discussion. In Spring, we added overlap analyses, where relevant, to the
renewal process. We have also initiated a process of evaluating the approval and firm
order purchasing patterns with circulation data and making changes to the approval
plan.
Ensure two-way communication with campus community about collections
- Why:

  - To ensure the campus is aware of existing resources and to provide an opportunity for
feedback in case of changes to the collections
- How:
  - Identify underperforming electronic subscriptions.
  - Develop promotional plan to publicize and increase use of selected collections.
  - In conjunction with liaisons, develop process to gather patron feedback
  - Analyze community feedback 2-3 months in advance of renewal deadline.
- Success Looks Like:
  - Cancellation or changes to underperforming subscriptions
  - Collections promoted through Marketing and Communications Team channels
  - Feedback collected on underperforming subscriptions
- Fall Update
  - During Fall 2024, we maintained contributions to the Library’s newsletter, Letters from
the Library, that promoted collections that we sought to raise awareness of. We also
used the liaison program to reach and gather information regarding potential cuts when
appropriate.
- Spring Update
  - In Spring, we continued to eliminate underperforming resources and promoted
resources through the Letters from the Library newsletter. As appropriate, we used the
liaison program to evaluate the potential loss of subscriptions before making a decision.
Make recommendations on collection renewals, new subscriptions, approval plan purchasing, and firm
order areas of emphasis.
- Why:
  - To maintain a rich, diverse, and valued set of collections
- How:
  - Recommendation at least one month prior to renewal deadline for continuation or
cancellation of each subscription resource.
  - Report to selectors and admin at least once per year on trends in firm order circulation
  - Report to selectors and admin at least once per year on trends in approval plan
circulation, with recommendation for changes as needed.
  - Determine CPU standards (e.g., minimum acceptable usage) for non-journal content like
A&I databases
- Success Looks Like:
  - Meeting renewal deadlines
  - Receiving feedback from selectors regarding trends in approval/firm order circulation
- Fall Update
  - We have met all of our renewal deadlines in the Fall 2024 with recommendations. We
are currently creating/designing reports to send out to selectors regarding trends in
book circulation. We have not yet addressed CPU standards for non-journal content.
- Spring Update
  - We have continued to meet our renewal deadlines. In Spring we sent reports to the
liaisons regarding book ordering in different LC subject areas to get feedback on changes
to ordering. Having received little feedback, we have moved forward with plans to shift
more book spending onto demand-driven channels and re-educate liaisons on book
ordering procedures and processes.

  - We have also begun to address standards for CPU-like measures for non-journal
content. Discovery and Acquisitions developed a spreadsheet to use in comparing
similar non-journal content’s CPUs (i.e. full-text databases, abstracting and indexing
services, etc.) and identifying the proper usage metrics for those resources (e.g. for A&I
services looking at searches vs. investigations). This will allow us to consider the value of
those databases separately from journal content. We also have reports on ebook usage
and are beginning to review that content.

**Final Outcomes**
The Collections Team maintained strong, consistent progress on achieving our team goals. We kept at
improving our processes for evaluating collections on time and in advance of deadlines. We added
elements to improve the quality of our decision-making, like the introduction of overlap analysis and a
rethinking of our metrics used in evaluating abstracting and indexing databases. We also tackled the
approval and firm order project with more verve this year, yielding some improvements in our data – we
identified a few process errors that affected our information – and a plan to adjust our approval plans to
better fit our campus needs and requirements.
**Accomplishments**
- Produced better circulation and ordering analyses for making decisions about approval plans
and firm ordering
- Identified errors in some of our processes that affected data and reports
- Consistently renewed or cancelled resources on time and schedule, giving each resource its
consideration
- With approximate $96,000 of inflation going into FY25, we were able to trim the continuing
resources budget by $103,694
- Adding a long-sought engineering standards resource in the ASTM Compass database
- Began to develop a process for reviewing non-journal resources in a systematic way by
producing better reports and data to use in evaluating them

- Produced a regular Letters from the Library feature to highlight resources
**Challenges**
- Some of our evaluations are still in their infancy – evaluating Read and Publish agreements, for
example. They are complex and there are a range of ways to evaluate them.
- Usage for print materials continues to decline. There is a tension between following metrics (like
usage) as targets and building formative and quality scholarly collections regardless of metrics,
especially for a research library.
- Future cuts to the collections may be increasingly fraught. Some of the items that are seeing
declining use but cost quite a bit may be more politically challenging or seemingly essential to a
discipline.
- Liaisons as a feedback mechanism hasn’t been too productive (exception of those on the
Collections Team).
**Opportunities**
- More direct engagement with liaisons at the Collections Team meetings to invite dialogue and
feedback.
- Shift more book purchasing onto demand-driven channels, such as implementing faculty
requests in Primo/Alma.
- Formalize more variation in how liaisons manage their collections – encouraging those with less
investment in doing collection development to automate more of their processes, while
allowing others to do more bespoke collection development.

Digital Collections Team 2024-25
**Overview:**
The Digital Collections Team works to determine policy and workflows for the production and publishing
of digital collections to produce a consistent, engaging user experience for patrons across the Library’s
web platforms and discovery services. The team encourages ownership of and communication regarding
digital collections and staff and faculty investment in their excellence across the library.
**Library KPIs:**
- Digital Collections (Primary)
  - Extant digital collections
  - Newly created digital collections
  - Total pages/items
  - Usage of digital collections (see Web Properties)
  - Web Properties
  - Fellowships
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Guidelines and procedures are created for the digital archive drive and Special Collection & Archive’s
born-digital collection development processes.
  - Why:
▪ Improve the documentation and effectiveness of our digital preservation
practices
  - How:
▪ Review digital archive drives for documentation and organization
▪ Procedures for born-digital collection development discussed, drafted, and
revised using feedback from team
  - Success looks like:
▪ 80% of our digital archive drives will be reviewed and improved with
documentation and organization by the end of the 2025 Spring Semester.
▪ Procedures for born-digital collection development processes are
communicated and supported by the team.
  - Fall Update:
▪ With a new digital archivist onboarding and developing workflows, this has not
been a focus for fall 2024.
▪ Once high priority Archive-It needs have been fulfilled, the team will coordinate
a presentation with Rebecca Hastings to ensure the group understands how the
software functions and other digital preservation opportunities we can explore,
in addition to the above goals of digital archive drive review and improvement.

  - Spring Update:
▪ Most high-priority web content has been successfully captured using Archive-It
in advance of the university website overhaul. A few additional capture requests
may still come in as we approach the transition date.
▪ We’ve begun considering additional applications for Archive-It beyond archiving
the main university site. While no major expansions occurred this year, this
remains an area of interest for future development.
▪ The Spec partition of the Archive Drive remains in solid shape and continues to
meet current needs. The general partition still requires review and
organizational cleanup. Minimal progress was made on this front during the
year, and further work is recommended in the coming year.
Review Digital Collections for accessibility of media files and improve with additional connective,
interpretive material.
  - Why:
▪ Improve the quality and accessibility of our digital collections in light of the
upcoming DOJ ADA rule change deadline
  - How:
▪ Review digital collections media files for accessibility, particularly alt text and
transcript availability
▪ Identify and address any accessibility issues that may be discovered, and discuss
and institute accessibility improvements as necessary
  - Success looks like:
▪ 100% of our digital collections are Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
2.1 Level AA accessible, meeting the new DOJ ADA requirements for title 2
  - Fall Update:
▪ All of the four monthly Digital Collection Team meeting and the six bi-weekly
check-in meetings have centered on gauging the current accessibility of our
digital collections in anticipation of the DOJ ADA ruling. Work has included
overviewing the ruling and it’s definition of terms, conducting a survey of a
sample of digital collections, testing accuracy of Python tools for generating alt
text descriptions and beginning a conversation around changing metadata
description practices in the future.
▪ Some elements of digital collections, like maps and data visualizations, remain
challenging for accessibility. Since no widely accessible solutions exist for these
materials, the WCAG AA Guidelines do not provide explicit requirements for
them.
▪ This process also involved creating transcripts for 230 audio files that previously
lacked transcriptions over the summer of 2024.
  - Spring Update:

▪ Using the Taylor Wilderness Research Station Archive and the Context Podcast
Digital Collections as launchpads, the Digital Collection Team and Devin Becker
collaborated to improve the accessibility of the Oral History as Data template
and standardize it closer to our central digital collection templates.
▪ After an attempt at interdepartmental testing was unsuccessful, the team
collaborated to create two accessibility testing devices on Linux laptops
equipped with Orca screen readers for testing library web sites.
▪ The team has hired and will supervise a student worker throughout summer of
2025 to transcribe the remaining 60 LCOH audio files.
▪ Presentations were given about an iteration of an AI computer vision Python
tool that could be used to describe photos for alt text fields or simply extract
text from images, and it’s strengths and weaknesses. Special collections is
experimenting with other AI workflows on collections that will be published this
summer and opportunities with these tools continue to be of interest in the
coming year.
Improve user engagement with our digital collections through use of web statistics
  - Why:
▪ To measure and improve upon user experience and user acquisition for our
digital collections
  - How:
▪ Use Google Analytics and other data sources to evaluate engagement
throughout the collections and make improvements to areas where
necessary/available
  - Success looks like:
▪ Using analysis of user behavior, revisions are made to our digital collections
infrastructure that improve engagement and/or acquisition of users for our
digital collections
  - Fall Update:
▪ While this period did undertake an extensive redesign for the digital collections
browse page and updates across all digital collections, these were driven by a
need to update template elements and the development of a new tool which
allows the patron to search across collections. That said, one of the goals for this
Spring period can be using analytics to track how users are engaging with the
browse and search pages to inform a possible redesign. Analytics Dashboard
Report templates were developed for easier reading and recording of metrics.
  - Spring Update:
▪ Implementing analytics, accessibility standards and intuitive navigation, the
digital collections team undertook redesigning and rewriting the Digital
Collection Docs Page, the Digital Collection Browse Page, the base template

About Page, the Special Collections Page and completed the search tool, which
included opting in all applicable digital collections to this functionality.
▪ Formalizing the Digital Collection Lauch Checklist and incorporating GA4 QR
codes into outreach material over the course of this year has also helped us to
understand what types of campaigns are most effective.
**Unit/Team Metrics:**
  - # of digital archive folders reviewed for documentation and organization
  - % of archive drive documented
  - # of published documentation for preservation workflows and guidelines
  - # of digital collections meeting WCAG 2.1 AA

Possible Revisions/Additions to Objectives for 2025-2026
Work in progress from discussion with next year’s digital collection team lead Rebecca
Hastings.
- Enriching About Pages
- Improving image quality on some collections
  - Such as Iddings Lantern Slide
  - Thinking about watermarked images and rescanning
- Same archive drive objective but maybe more precise language
- Accessibility – feeling good on audit and transcripts but thinking about rubric for taking
on university wide materials. What is reasonable to maintain and how do we
communicate that?
- Accessibility – testing on devices that we have set up with screen readers. What does
the testing look like?
- Accessibility – formalizing Alt Text processes
- AI – Can we use our own tools and refine the Python iterations for extracting text and
describing images? Better than working with third party tools and keeps us
communicating about developing tech.
Overall: thinking about how to lessen the impact of possible data emergencies in the future.

**DISCOVERY TEAM, 2024-2025**
Updated 8/14/24
**Overview:**
The Discovery Team is responsible for optimizing discovery of the library’s resources. Team members
participate in systematic testing of specific features/options, keeping in mind diverse patron needs.
**Library KPIs:**
- Online catalog (Primary responsibility)
- Course reserves (Relevant)
- Electronic resources (Relevant)
- Physical Circulation (Relevant)
- Web properties (Relevant)
Meeting Minutes
- 2024-2025_running Meeting Minutes.docx
**Objectives:**
- OBJECTIVE #1: Maintain or enhance Primo as an accessible and inclusive discovery tool, by
identifying features/options for implementation.
  - Why:
▪ Primo is one of the library’s primary discovery tools and is used by patrons to
identify information relevant to their educational needs.
  - How:
▪ Make recommendations/decisions on configurations, following each new Primo
quarterly release.
▪ Create/maintain/analyze relevant analytics reports related to Primo usage
▪ Map configuration changes to relevant analytics reports for analysis
  - Success looks like:
▪ Implementation of new Primo features useful to patrons.
▪ Decisions made on configuration based on patron usage.
  - Fall Update:
▪ This semester, the team tested four new Primo VE features and decided
collectively not to implement any of them at this time.
  - Spring Update:
▪ This semester, the team tested three new Primo VE features and decided
collectively not to implement any of them at this time.
- OBJECTIVE #2: Ensure cohesion among the library’s various discovery tools.

  - Why:
▪ To ensure a consistent patron experience as they use various tools to find the
information they need.
  - How:
▪ Review and test library discovery tools.
▪ Identify inconsistencies in search mechanisms, design, and branding among
discovery tools available on the library’s website.
▪ Identify changes that will contribute to a consistent patron experience.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Similar or well-defined search mechanisms, design, and branding among
discovery tools.
  - Fall Update
▪ The team developed a plan for reviewing the discovery tools, focusing on
documenting observations related to search scope and accuracy, design and
branding consistency, user experience issues or barriers, and recommendations
for improvements. The team is scheduled to meet in February 2025 to discuss
findings from these observations, aiming to address the KPI for Objective #2:
ensuring cohesion among the library’s various discovery tools.
  - Spring Update
▪ Each team member tested one or more discovery tools and documented their
findings on search scope and accuracy, design and branding consistency, user
experience issues or barriers, and recommendations for improvements. Several
inconsistencies in search mechanisms, design, and branding among discovery
tools have been identified and corrected.
**Final Outcomes**
This year, the team evaluated new Primo VE features and collectively decided not to implement any at
this time. Additionally, the team successfully tested nine discovery tools and resolved the identified
inconsistencies. Both objectives for the year were fully accomplished.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
Looking ahead, the team will engage in several projects over the summer, including reviewing the
language used for ILL/Summit services, assessing EBSCO’s Natural Language Search functionality, and
conducting usability testing of an AI research assistant. In the coming year, the team will continue
evaluating new Primo VE features and work to optimize related discovery tools.
**Metrics:**
- # of usage reports created
- # of configuration options tested
- # of configuration options implemented
- # of Discovery tools reviewed
- U/A Testing?

  - Research and Reference Assistance
  - Workshops and Presentations
  - Instruction
FYE meeting running agendas and notes 2024-25
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Provide orientation and instruction to Engl101 students
- Why:
  - New students will be more successful if they know about and use the resources and
services located in the library or through our website
- How:
  - Refine and implement Engl101 orientation scavenger hunt activity
  - Develop and implement Engl101 activity for students to learn how to find books and
articles and to use reference services, particularly online chat
- Success looks like:
  - The majority of groups participating in the ENGL101 activities and responding to the
survey indicate that they are aware of library resources and services and will likely
return to use them. They are also able to list resources and services that they think
will be helpful.
  - Fall 2024 update: Below are the survey results from the early fall Engl101 activities.
▪ 20 Engl101 tour times were offered, attended by 45 sections, around 852
students.
▪ 752 students completed the survey, 86% of all ENGL101 students from Fall
2024.
▪ 99.66% of respondents indicated that they would return to the library to
utilize a resource. The breakdown is as follows:
Q23 - Select all of the resources that you Percenta
think you would use here in the library. ge
Study Rooms 71.82%
Tutoring 70.10%
Research Help 63.92%
Print Books 59.45%

**MILL 54.30%**
Studio 48.11%
Maps 44.33%
Data Hub 42.61%
DVDs 41.24%
Course Reserves 40.55%
Magazines/Newspapers 35.40%
Special Collections 31.62%
  - Spring 2025 Update
▪ 14 sections (277 students) attended tours in January 2025.
▪ In previous spring semesters, we had offered the tours as an option to
Engl101 instructors for their sections instead of requiring attendance. This
was based on previous experience indicating that many spring Engl101
students had already had a class with a library introduction in the fall.
However, we found out this no longer seemed to be true, so we decided to
schedule and require all sections to attend. When informally surveying
instructors and students, we found that most had not had Engl101 or
another library session before and quite a few were new students to the
campus. Therefore, we found that requiring these tours during the spring
semester was appreciated and effective.
▪ KPIs are collected in the fall semester for this activity so there is no updated
survey results. I am confident that the results would be similar to fall survey
results.
  - Final Outcomes
▪ This activity continues to be effective. Both students and Engl101 instructors
seem to enjoy and support it. Some questions and details need revision, but
the overall management, implementation and assessment of the activity
should proceed next year.
  - The majority of groups participating in the book and article activity indicate that
their confidence in finding books and articles in the library improved by the end of
the activity.
▪ Fall 2024 update: As this was a new activity, we expected some challenges.
Overall, it went well, with students engaging with the chat service and
locating books. We received feedback from Tyler Easterbook and Engl101
instructors. We are making some changes based on assessment for the
spring semester. One change is to make it more of a stand-alone activity,
with the goal of learning more about library organization and assistance.
The Engl101 essay following the activity will no longer contain a group
bibliography, so we will create our own topics and groups when classes
arrive.
▪ Spring 2025 Update

- 207 students in 14 sections participated in the Engl101 book
and article finding activity in spring 2025.
- After communication with the FYC director and Engl101 instructors,
we revised the book and article activity in a couple significant ways.
We decoupled it from the writing assignment as mentioned in the
fall update. This allowed more flexibility in scheduling. While it
generally is beneficial to connect library instruction with
assignments, it didn’t seem to be effective in the fall. Part of the
issue was that our activity was based on the original plan of having
students do group research, which didn’t work well in Engl101.
Therefore, by having this as a standalone activity, librarians helped
students form groups based on the attendance that day (eliminating
issues with absent students in a previously formed group). Also, we
provided topics that had been checked against books available in
our library. Groups picked a topic from a container. This made for
more successful book searches. These changes seemed very
effective. Students seemed less confused and more engaged than in
the fall and it lessened the burden on Engl101 instructors.
▪ Final Outcomes
- FYE added the book and article activity this year and it was largely
developed based on the desire of the FYC director to provide more
library research skills experience to Engl101 students. We tried to
design it so that it did not require a lot of actual instruction or
preparation for the librarians. Therefore, we used small groups to
reduce total numbers and a Qualtrics survey they could largely use
on their own. However, preparation, scheduling, monitoring,
meeting, covering chat and follow up still add up. During the class
sessions there is heavy use of the online chat service, which the FYE
librarians tried to cover. This became more of a burden than
expected. Therefore, the activity still felt like a significant addition to
the teaching load of the FYE librarians, despite the “self-directed”
approach. There needs to be some discussion and consideration of
the sustainability of this activity to decide how and whether to
continue it.
Provide integrated information literacy instruction in Engl102
- Why:
  - Empower students to develop foundational and transferable information literacy
skills
- How:
  - Collaboration with First-Year Writing Director and course instructors
  - Teach ENGL102 instruction sessions in-person and provide online equivalent
content for online sections
  - Develop and revise ENGL102 instructional content and grade library assignments
  - Support students as they complete their ENGL 102 research assignment.
- Success looks like:

  - Continued partnership with the First-Year Writing Program and Director
▪ Fall 2024 update: After collaborating with Tyler Easterbrook on changes in
our library instruction to match the new curriculum, we feel the move to link
our assignment to the now-required annotated bibliography was quite
helpful. Informal assessment indicates that it improved the relevance of our
instruction and assignment. Some instructors indicated that they needed to
adjust the timing of the library sessions in spring semester, as they had
based their fall scheduling requests on the previous curriculum.
▪ Spring 2025 Update
- The updated library unit continued to work well with the new
curriculum. Spring semester scheduling, instruction and results were
largely similar to the fall. Therefore, if the First Year Composition
program does not change its curriculum, we should continue with a
similar approach in the next academic year. Connecting the library
assignment to the annotated bibliography remains a key component
of success. In-person instruction by librarians (for in-person
sections) is also considered essential.
▪ Final Outcomes
- Our collaboration and implementation of library instruction with the
new curriculum was successful, based on instructor and librarian
feedback as well as student assignment assessment (below). For
next academic year, it will be important to meet with the FYC
director to determine if there will be any changes to the curriculum.
If not, we can retain most of the library unit (with minor revisions),
but may want to consider ways of streamlining the grading of
assignments by librarians. Grading continues to be a time
consuming task and there is some question about whether students
benefit from or take advantage of the effort librarians make in
grading.
  - Data collected indicates that the majority of students who attended ENGL 102
library sessions and submitted the assignment retained the foundational
information literacy skills taught during Library week
▪ Fall 2024 update: In fall 2024, 76% of Engl102 students (n=688) submitted a
library assignment, and 95% of those completed 75% of the answers
correctly. These numbers indicate library faculty are having a positive impact
on Engl102 students information literacy.
▪ Spring 2025 Update
- In spring 2025, 72% of Engl102 students (n=696) submitted a library
assignment, and 92% of those completed 75% of the answers
correctly. These numbers continue indicate library faculty are having
a positive impact on Engl102 students information literacy. While
the percentages are somewhat lower than in fall, there are some
differences in the population of students who take Engl102 in the
spring semester compared to fall.
▪ Final Outcomes

- While there may be some revisions needed in the assignment and in
the instruction, overall the results indicate that students are finding
the assignment worth completing and learning foundational
information literacy skills that they can apply to research for their
annotated bibliography. It also indicates that the collaboration with
the FY Composition program is effective since instructors support the
library sessions, unit and assignment and encourage their students
to participate and complete it.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
- Our current FY instruction program continues to be high-touch, engaging and instructionally
effective.
- The instruction load (including prep, communications, Canvas management, in-person
instruction, grading and Information Landscape (IL) workshops) for FYE librarians is very high
and may not be sustainable without some changes.
- While many other library faculty teach IL workshops, the bulk of the burden for managing them
falls to FYE. This hidden work includes recruiting for and scheduling the workshops, creating
links and handouts to it, creating the attendance spreadsheets, promoting the workshops in class
announcements, recording attendance, reminding students, responding to student questions,
assigning asynchronous options, communicating with instructors, etc. We may need to find
efficiencies, perhaps in grading, IL workshop management or Engl101 activity implementation,
including alternate ways of covering chat service during the book and article activity.
- With a new team leader and new instruction librarian incoming, there may be opportunities for
new ideas and approaches.

Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Host a series of conversations around Instruction techniques and practices among all faculty
  - Why:
▪ Improve collaboration, assessment, and understanding of instructional practices
across diverse faculty practices
  - How:
▪ Modelling this after AI sessions from January 2024, set up a series of 2-3
sessions (1-2 hours long) that cover: individual pedagogical practices, general
information literacy pedagogical ideals/theories, AI use in pedagogy going
forward, and an initial discussion of scaffolding of content/objectives
  - Success looks like:
▪ Planning, execution, and delivery of series in Fall 2024
  - Fall 2024 Update:
▪ The Instruction Team held three faculty conversations:
- Thursday, October 24

  - Topic: Scaffolding information literacy learning objectives across
the curriculum
  - Speaker: Tyler Easterbook, Director of First Year Composition
- Friday, November 8
  - Topic: Teaching methods, in-person and online, for one-shot
presentations
  - Speaker: Jen Elbek, CETL (via Zoom)
- Thursday, December 5
  - Topic: AI in information literacy instruction
  - Speakers: Bert Baumgaertner and Casey Johnson
We had attendance of the majority of faculty at each and good
engagement. With the first two, the team had faculty contribute
content during activities, and that information is available in the
Instruction Team folder.
  - Spring 2025 Update
- No new conversations were held during spring semester.
  - Final Outcomes
- The Instruction Team was successful in gathering faculty for professional development
and conversation. The faculty had not really done this type of sharing in some time. This
could be a model going forward.
Scaffold learning objectives and instructional content across lower and upper division instruction
  - Why:
▪ Improve coherence of information literacy instruction for students
▪ Improve quality and coherence of instruction practices for all faculty
  - How:
▪ Continue improving draft of charts and documents laying out levels and
types of information literacy instruction across divisions
▪ Build consensus among faculty about categories/divisions and approaches
  - Success looks like:
▪ Finalized and distributed curriculum map in use for library faculty by the
Spring Semester
- Fall 2024 Update
  - At the faculty discussion on October 24, faculty reacted to a
draft curriculum map that Norm developed from earlier content.
Small groups of faculty provided written feedback in group
documents (Faculty discussion on learning objectives October
24) The team plans to use this content and develop a public-
facing document or infographic that explains our learning
objectives across the curriculum.

- Spring 2025 Update
  - The Instruction Team discussed the charge for creating the
content regarding learning objectives in the January 2025
meeting (Instruction Team Running agenda and notes 2024-
25.docx) Dulce brought our questions and comments to the
Leadership Team. Eventually, Leadership shifted the charge for
this to become a library-wide project to create Library Literacies.
The work then moved out of the Instruction Team and is mostly
complete, but still in progress.
- Final Outcomes
  - Due in part to the Instruction Team’s previous year’s work and
fall faculty conversation on scaffolding and instructional
content, the library now has developed a solid draft of literacies
that will be important in guiding our future instructional
**objectives**
Aggregate all online instructional content into one accessible portal
  - Why:
▪ Improve coherence and discovery of online resources for students,
▪ Improve usability and access of resources for those new to using library
resources
  - How:
▪ Work with Library Website team to:
- Create a central landing page that directs students towards relevant
resources
▪ Create navigational cues throughout the website to direct students in
need to asynchronous resources
▪ Facilitate the creation of walkthroughs/tutorials for new users that offer
varied options and mediums (video, textual, interactive) for learning basic
library skills and get feedback from team and interested parties
  - Success looks like:
▪ Publish new landing page, visual cues, and resources/tutorials by the Spring
Semester
▪ Fall 2024 update
- On Monday, September 9 (see Instruction Team Running agenda and
notes 2024-25.docx) the team discussed the work completed during the
summer by Hanwen and Norm. We made comments and determined
that the next step should be to take the proposal to the Web Team.
- Spring 2025 Update
  - Our proposal is still awaiting the next step from the Web Team.

- Final Outcomes
  - Norm and Hanwen, in collaboration with the Instruction Team,
have developed a solid proposal for a landing page which would
improve access to our online instructional materials. Hopefully
it will be prominently linked on the revised Library website.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
- The Instruction Team worked on three major objectives this past year and feels it
accomplished a great deal. It does not seem like the team needs to take on as much
next year.
- One challenge is that we could not move forward on the instructional materials landing
page because the next step lies with the Web Team. When the web team is ready, the
Instruction Team could provide insight and input about asynchronous instructional
materials on the library website.
- Scheduling and finding enthusiasm for attendance at formal faculty conversations
can be challenging. This team believes its best use of time going forward is to
support a “community of practice” for instruction across the library faculty. This
could be set up more informally, perhaps as “brown bags” and without outside
speakers.

**LIAISONS TEAM 2024-2025**
**Overview:**
The Liaison team enriches formal and informal learning opportunities and advances the
research, scholarly, and creative activity of faculty and students by broadly communicating
library offerings, services, and capacities, building individual and institutional relationships with
faculty in the various colleges, and providing discipline specific instruction and assistance for
students and faculty.

**Meeting Minutes:**
- Meeting Agenda 2024-2025.docx
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Library liaisons will engage in significant interactions and collaborations (as recorded on the
interactions form) with faculty and students from across the University
- Why:
  - To build connections across campus and advance the educational and research
missions of the university
- How:
  - Support university faculty and students in Liaison areas through research
assistance, instruction support, and project collaboration
- Success looks like:
  - Liaisons and faculty will, by year’s end, have had at least one significant
interaction with students and/or faculty from every department on campus.
- Fall Update:

  - Currently we have not come close to meeting this goal. We have not interacted
with 15 departments, including (by college):
▪ College of Art and Architecture
- architecture
- interior architecture and design
- landscape architecture
- virtual technology and design
▪ College of Agricultural and Life Sciences
- agricultural economics and rural sociology
- agricultural education, leadership, and communications
- margaret ritchie school of family and consumer sciences
▪ College of Business and Economics
- accounting and mis
▪ College of Education, Health and Human Sciences
- leadership and counseling
- movement sciences
▪ College of Engineering
▪ College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences
- lionel hampton school of music
- school of global studies
▪ College of Natural Resources
- natural resources and society
- fish and wildlife sciences
▪ College of Science
- Chemistry
- Spring Update:
  - Due to lack of interest and complexity of tracking, we decided to move on from
this goal.
Individual Library liaisons will share information about their liaison areas and practices with
the rest of the team
- Why:
  - Improve library faculty knowledge of university colleges and initiatives
  - Share practices and experiences to help other liaisons improve their work
- How:

  - Each Liaison will present to the team an overview of their college, colleges, or
area (GIS/SPEC) and their liaison activities therein.
- Success looks like:
  - Each liaison will present at least once during the year to the rest of the team
- Fall Update:
  - So far, four Liaisons have presented to the group on their respective areas and
colleges. These have covered CNR, CBE, CLASS (Social Sciences), and CDIL.
  - Presentations have led to fruitful discussions and suggestions for improved
service.
- Spring Update:
  - All Liaisons presented on their areas and/or specialties this year. We all found
these really illuminating, and the presentations led to some excellent
conversations and recommendations. I hope that having this grounding in each
others areas and practice will help this team move forward more collaboratively
and individuals do their jobs more effectively.
The Liaison Team will serve as a feedback mechanism for other library teams and for those
working on library initiatives
- Why:
  - Liaisons possess unique knowledge and experience of the university that can be
leveraged for advice and insight into possible library actions and projects.
- How:
  - The team will be available as a feedback mechanism for any other team or
faculty initiative via regular meetings and will advertise this function to the larger
library.
- Success looks like:
  - The team will provide feedback for several library programs/teams/initiatives
throughout the year
- Fall Update:
  - We have not received any requests for feedback yet. We also have not really
advertised our services in this regard ... For the spring, we will make sure folks
know this is an option.
- Spring Update:
  - We gave a small amount of feedback to the Collections team, but otherwise
didn’t do much in this area.

**Unit/Team Metrics:**

**Reporting to:**
- Dean
**Final Outcomes**
This was our first year operating as a mostly informational/social group, and I think reconfiguring
the group this way was a good start. Our main project was having everyone present on their
area. The presentations were really excellent overall, with individuals going into detail about
their networking, instruction, and collecting processes. The presentations about the liaisons’
colleges gave particularly good insights, and often led to discussions and recommendations
about/for individuals’ practice.
While feedback wasn’t specifically sought by any but the collections group this year, we did end
up considering the literacies project presented by the library as well. And while this part of the
objectives wasn’t really fulfilled, I believe establishing this baseline of shared practice will be
fruitful overall in this area, especially for the newer liaisons, as we look to invite more direct
collaboration going forward (see below).
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year

For next year, we intend to invite representatives from other teams to present for each meeting.
We’re thinking specifically we would like to hear from and converse with the following teams:
- Collections team
- Instructions team
- Research Impact team
- Open Engagement
- Wider University/Library Admin Update
And we’ll look to structure these conversations towards similar goals for this year –
information sharing and improving our practices.
Otherwise, this group looks forward to updating each other and conversing again next year.
Overall, this is a strong group of faculty doing excellent and important work for the library,
and we’d like to maintain our connections and expand our reach. As I work on the goals for
next year, I also look forward to finding some means toward collaborative work, perhaps
related to work with the Instruction Team and the ongoing literacies project, as I feel like
the intersection of those teams is a good spot for that work to be accomplished.

Mar Com Team
**Overview:**
The Marketing & Communications Team ensures consistent, coordinated, and professional
messaging from the Library to the wider university and general public about Library collections,
events, and services with the goal of increasing awareness and use of Library offerings.
**Library KPIs:**
- Relevant
  - Building Usage
  - Course Reserves
  - Digital Collections
  - Electronic Resources
  - Exhibits
  - Fellowships
  - Geographic Information Systems
  - Instruction
  - Physical Circulation
  - Research and Reference Assistance
  - Research Information Management
  - Special Collections & Archives
  - Student Savings
  - Web Properties
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
- Finish formalizing Mar Com processes.
  - Why:
▪ Ensure that users know about Library offerings in a timely way.
▪ Save staff and faculty time.
▪ Reduce confusion and redundant work.
  - How:
▪ Create, refine, and communicate to entire library
▪ Document fully in Library Annual Manual.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Consistent use of processes throughout Library.
**Final Outcomes**
A form for submitting marketing and communications requests was created
(https://tinyurl.com/Library Mar Com) and distributed to the Library; usage has been low, with about
twelve submissions. Continuing to remind people about this form/process will be important.
- Hire a student employee to help with social media accounts and possibly other marketing and
communication activities.
  - Why:
▪ Have more of a student voice in our marketing and communication efforts.

▪ Ensure consistent marketing and communication efforts.
▪ Lessen the burden on fulltime Library employees.
  - How:
▪ Hire a student in the fall
▪ Determine an appropriate scope and amount of work
▪ Document processes and expectations
  - Success looks like:
▪ A successful hire and a clear position description and set of goals that can be
used from year to year.
**Final Outcomes**
We hired a student and had success with him contributing to social media and working with our
templates. Though we gave him space to pursue his own marketing ideas, he didn’t end up
producing anything. It’s unclear if this is due to position description, expectations, or the
motivation of the individual in that position. Overall, this position was a success and could be
further developed to be more successful in the coming years.
- Continue distributing and improving “Letters from the Library.”
  - Why:
▪ Ensure that users know about Library offerings in a timely way.
  - How:
▪ Continue coordinating content and distribution using established processes.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Increasing newsletter usage statistics.
**Final Outcomes**
We published a total of eight monthly newsletters, though we only received statistics for five. The
table below shows a slight increase in our final newsletter, though this is not part of a sustained
trendline. These numbers give us a baseline to try and improve on next year.

**MENTORSHIP/SCHOLARSHIP TEAM**
**Overview:**
The Mentorship/Scholarship Team enhances faculty development through the creation of formal and
informal mentorship opportunities and fostering a supportive academic community via co-working and
professional development opportunities.
**Library KPIs:**
- Library Faculty Scholarship (Primary)
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Create cohort communication venues and mentorship possibilities for new librarians
- Why: Create cohesion and inclusion for new librarians
- How: Monthly/bi-Monthly meeting of new librarians, facilitated by team member
Conversations and inquiries to new librarians over the year regarding their need for
collaboration or mentorship
- Success looks like: Documented mentorship and collaboration occurring among new librarians
and between new librarians and those further along in their career.
- Fall update: We organized two virtual gatherings for the seven newest members of our faculty
(Tyler, Andrew, Norm, Rebecca, Kelley, Pam, and Leesa) to learn about important aspects of
Library culture and processes, as well as facilitate open conversations. The first meeting was
essentially a check-in to see how folks were doing in their first several months and solicit
feedback on the topics they’d like covered in future meetings. The second meeting covered
preparing for annual reviews, formatting CVs, and general productivity hacks. In the spring there
are one or two more meetings planned, at least one of which will be dedicated to the lifecycle of
a scholarly publication.
- Spring update: We organized one virtual gathering of the seven newest faculty members in
January, during which time Jylisa Kenyon gave an overview of the scholarly publication lifecycle
and then answered questions from attendees. We organized one in-person gathering in May to
cover topics including university hierarchy, communicating across campus, and scheduling and
leading meetings. That was facilitated by Dean Ben Hunter, Devin Becker, and Dulce Kersting-
Lark. A social hour followed the meeting, which offered a nice opportunity for the new
colleagues to reflect on the academic year.
Facilitate formal and informal collaboration opportunities for faculty
- Why: Support faculty librarian scholarship and improve library culture
- How: Facilitate First Friday scholarship sessions and invite all faculty. Facilitate one sprint-like
activity over a span of time that allows faculty to devote specific time for advancing scholarship
activities.
- Success looks like: Activities and sessions have been offered.

- Fall update: Over the fall semester the team organized three “Friday Faculty Meet-ups.” The
location of each meet-up changed – at IRIC, in Brink Hall, and at One World Cafe. Attendance
ranged from 4 to 8 attendees over the course of the semester. In addition to the meet-ups, the
team felt that more intentional celebration of our colleagues’ successes would benefit our
overall culture of scholarship. We developed a form to better track the proposals and
publications of significant work by librarians.
- Spring update: Four “Friday Faculty Meet-ups" were offered in the spring semester, held
alternately at One World Cafe and in IIRC. Attendance held steady at between 4 and 8. The
“Faculty Scholarship Wins” form was used throughout the semester. Since it launched in
November, it has been used 19 times. During the two spring faculty meetings, the most recent
submissions to the form were shared with the assembled group as a way to celebrate the
success of our colleagues.
Final Outcomes: The team had a successful year and met the majority of its goals. Although it did not
hold a sprint as originally planned, it did pursue meaningful ways to support junior colleagues and
encourage scholarly productivity across the faculty. The New/er Faculty Cohort was a useful vehicle for
mentoring the large number of recently hired librarians. The outlines from each of the four gatherings
held over the year can be used as a template moving forward for mentoring additional new colleagues,
even if it is in a one-one setting rather than a seven-person cohort.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year: In the next two to three years there will be many librarians
going through their 3rd year review and/or going up for tenure. The Mentorship-Scholarship Team
should be on the lookout for ways to support those colleagues. One option would be to offer “office
hours” with Associate Dean Devin Becker who could review CVs or scholarship plans with faculty who
would like additional guidance. We anticipate at least one new librarian will be joining the faculty in the
coming months, so the team will plan a handful of meetings with that new colleague to go over the
basics that the cohort covered this year. Finally, the scholarly landscape continues to change in both
large and small ways. The sudden termination of relevant grants this year needs to be discussed as a
faculty, as does the evolution of open access publication. Some brown-bag type meetings could be
organized during the academic year to bring about those conversations.

OPEN STRATEGIES TEAM Academic Year 2024-2025
Created May 23, 2025
Finalized June 5th, 2025
**Overview:**
The Open Strategies Team supports student success and the transformation of scholarly communication
by building understanding, engagement, and capacity for open access, open education, and open
scholarship practices both in the Library and throughout the university.
**Library KPIs:**
- Course Reserves required course materials
  - Estimated total savings for students for AY 24-25 is $174,437, across 64 courses and
reaching 1,927 students.
From OST KPI’s
- Student Savings (Primary)
  - Amount saved via Think Open program:
▪ This year we did not have any new Think Open Fellowships.
▪ Program savings to date is estimated to be: $877,892
  - Amount saved via Reserves
▪ $174,437 is the 24-25 year estimate for savings for required course materials
offered in course reserves
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
1) Make University of Idaho students' education more affordable
  - Why:
▪ To save students money and Increase access to materials for students and overall
affordability of education at the university
  - How:
▪ Support and promote the use of open educational resources, open textbooks, open
pedagogy practices, and other strategies
▪ Create a workshop Mini-Series on Open on Campus, 3 to 4 short video workshops to get
folks up to speed
▪ Focus course marking communications to staff and faculty vs messaging to students
▪ Increase low and zero-cost courses offered on campus
  - Success looks like:

▪ Save students at least $100,000 through open practices
**Fall Updates:**
  - Links to the Open at U of I pressbook and course marking tool were added to the Course
Marking page in lieu of creating a video for finding these tools
  - Discussions were had re: marketing/communicating course marking initiative:
  - Having a representative at the bookstore during textbook adoption time to discuss
course marking (inclusive access has a representative)
  - Presenting on course marking at faculty orientation
  - Involving academic advisors
**Spring Updates:**
  - Planning an OA week for October 2025 to help build faculty awareness around Open
  - Planning and deciding a communication format to share Open opportunities both
hosted by the library and elsewise (likely a blog with an email list blast to previous
Think Open fellows and other Open interested folks)
  - Key findings from the 2023 survey show:
  - Students report needing only modest price reductions ($11) to make classes
materials feel mor affordable
  - Around half are skipping a required text
  - 18% report not having a choice in what classes they pick
  - The most expensive colleges are SBE and SAA, however the SAA students
report a bigger affordability gap (SBE students actually report they can afford
their materials). EHHS also has a notable affordability gap. Work with Liaisons
to share what their college findings are.
2) Leverage Verso to measure and improve OA publication on campus, including CDIL projects,
Pressbook publications, and open access publication by the faculty, particularly related to the
Open Access Publishing Fund
  - Why:
▪ To create a better understanding of and support infrastructure for open access
publishing on campus
  - How:
▪ Use OAPF to help faculty publish their articles as open access
▪ Improve tools and options available for open publishing on campus
▪ Work with Research Impact Team to use VERSO to measure and increase visibility for
open access publications (including OAPF articles) and projects by university faculty

▪ Measure engagement and create persistent open presences for Pressbooks and CDIL
projects via VERSO and its DOI functionalities
  - Success looks like:
▪ OAPF funds expended
▪ DOIs assigned to pressbooks, CDIL projects, and select digital
collections (as decided by team)
▪ Statistics tracked/communicated via VERSO for OAPF and OA
articles generally in OA Campus Report
**Fall update:**
  - Took over the OAPF Collection in VERSO
  - Currently up to date through FY24, includes 147 articles
  - Drafted OAPF VERSO workflow for keeping the collection updated in conjunction
with annual OAPF reports
  - Most catalogued pressbooks added into VERSO and library catalog
  - Other pressbook policies (including DOIs) in progress
  - Proposed metrics to track via VERSO:
  - # of OA-tagged items (4,092)
  - # of OA peer-reviewed journals (1,200)
  - OAPF funding period #1 fully encumbered as of 11/7 ($15,000)
**Spring update:**
  - OAPF funding period #2 fully encumbered as of 3/27 ($15,000)
  - Explored questions related to DOI authority and how to balance that across our diverse
digital ecosystem of Pressbooks, CDIL projects, and other
3) Assess contractual and other opportunities for advancing open activities on campus through
contracts (i.e. Transformative Publishing Agreements, etc.)
**▪ Why:**
- Better understand open publishing possibilities available via subscription
**▪ How:**
▪ Track and assess the various options available to the library via subscription
▪ Communicate opportunities to collections team, the dean, and library faculty
regularly
**▪ Success looks like:**
  - Final report in Spring 2025 that outlines possible contractual opportunities for
increasing open activities on campus
**Fall update:**
  - Received access to tracking data from Rami
  - APC savings from 2023 to 2024: $97,547

  - Identified some ways to improve tracking:
▪ # of departments and colleges represented
▪ Reorganize the data
  - Identified ways to improve communication re: agreements:
  - Add links/lists of specific journals covered under agreement (e.g., Spring Nature only
waives fees for hybrid journal APCs and provides a list on their site)
  - Update call out to transformative agreements on OAPF pages as potential
alternative
  - Update page organization
  - Identified most common publishers from OAPF that could be worth pursuing agreements
**with:**
  - Frontiers (16 OAPF-funded articles)
  - Wiley (15) (I believe this is in progress?)
  - PLOS (8)
**Spring update:**
  - The OAPF FAQ regarding transformative agreements has been updated to reflect the
library’s expanded read and publish agreements, as well as a link to VERSO.
**Unit/Team Metrics:**
▪ # of think open inquiries and applications
  - 0, likely due to Marco being out but also suggests less organic interest than in
previous peak years
▪ # of staff and faculty communications regarding affordability/open
  - 38 contacts regarding OAPF
▪ i/o Publish campus open survey report
  - The scholarly article for the undergraduate results is almost ready. Leesa and Marco are
working on an outreach strategy to share the results.
▪ # of Open Access publications by U of I faculty
▪ 2,261 of 21,508 total faculty & research scholarship items
▪ % of faculty work in RIM system that is openly accessible
  - 10.5% is OA
**Membership:**
▪ Marco Seiferle-Valencia (Lead)
▪ Leesa Love
▪ Bruce Godfrey
▪ Maryelizabeth Koepele

▪ Kelly Omodt
▪ Tyler Rodrigues
▪ Victoria Kerr (Leganto)
**Reporting to:**
- Associate Dean, Research & Instruction
**Final Outcomes**
- Objective 1 – Savings Students Money
  - We did not have new Think Open Fellowships, but we still estimated
$170,000 in annual savings from existing fellowships
  - The Think Open program savings to date is estimated at around $875,000
  - Course reserves saved students around $175,000 this year by offering
required materials for 64 courses, and reaching approximately 2,000
students. This means about 16% of Vandal students are using course
reserves.
- Objective 2 – Leverage Verso and Maintain OAPF
  - Created and updated the OAPF collection in Verso, creating a record of all
scholarship funded by the OAPF since inception
  - Collaborated with other teams to link VERSO, Pressbooks, Library
generated DOI’s, with the library catalog to improve discoverability
- Objective 3 – Assess transformative publishing agreement possibilities
  - Researched and understood transformative publishing agreements
▪ APC savings from 2023 to 2024: $97,547
  - Identified specific strategies to improve communication
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
For objective 1, student savings, our focus will be on outreach to course schedulers, to
ensure existing zero and very low cost courses are marked. We saw a big drop off in marked
courses because the library was not able to do outreach this year. We are also planning to
connect with CETL and hopefully catch more faculty earlier on in their course material decisions
process.
Additionally, we are planning an OA week event and OA-centered podcast, which are
hoped to help demonstrate what we are already doing, celebrate students and faculty who have
been participating in open across campus, and help get people inspired about new projects.
This will also likely be an opportunity to present the findings from the 2023 student course
materials affordability survey.

We will be deemphasizing the cost savings and volume of Think Open fellowships going
forward but still offering them as curricular fellowships through CDIL. We saw less interest in
Think Open this last year, though it is unclear if that is related to Marco being out and there
being less outreach and promotion.
For objective 2, VERSO outreach, the OST may have met our core goals here of making
sure we have strategic connection and representation of OA published properties in VERSO.
Similarly, objective 3, saw a lot of progress, with research and internal Infromation sharing on
transformative publishing agreements. However, more work remains to communicate both these
opportunities to stakeholders and potential users.
These proposed ideas work well with the proposed vision of moving some of the KPI’S
collected by OST to actually being DSOS unit KPI’s, and restructuring and recharging the OST
team to be focused on open campus engagement with the libraries open and cost savings
options.

Physical Spaces and Public Programming Team
Academic Year 2024-2025
Last updated 06/16/2025
**Overview:**
The Physical Spaces and Public Programming Team seeks to provide safe, usable, and accessible
public spaces for U of I affiliates and community members who visit the UI Library in-person.
They make space recommendations to library leadership based on local space assessments and
national library trends. They also oversee the physical use of the building for programming and
events.
**Library KPIs:**
- Exhibits (Primary responsibility)
- Building usage (Relevant)
**Meeting Agenda:**
- 2024-25 Physical Spaces & Public Programming Agenda.docx
**Objectives:**
*Fall updates in blue.
*Spring updates in pink.
**● OBJECTIVE #1:**
  - Ensure accessible and usable spaces that meet the diverse needs of Library
patrons by collecting and analyzing data on usage and by monitoring trends
(local and national) over time.
**➢ Why:**
▪ Ensure the campus community and public patrons have adequate space
to meet their educational needs.
**➢ How:**
▪ Provide reservable spaces that meet the diverse needs of U of I students.
▪ Prioritized recommendations to remedy and/or improve areas where
accessibility is problematic.
▪ Address building issues reported by employees and patrons.
▪ Maintain relationship with campus safety operations.
▪ Walk-through conducted at the end of each semester to document
building and furniture issues (like broken chairs, damaged white boards,
etc.) that need to be addressed.
▪ Ensure brand unity in library signage.
▪ Updates made to the Library Floor Maps on an as-needed basis.
**➢ Success looks like:**
▪ Steady or increasing usage of library public spaces.
**➢ Fall Updates:**

▪ Lib Cal reservations are being utilized.
▪ Groups inquiring about spaces are being referred to the appropriate PSPP
members and relevant Access Services staff.
▪ We are prioritizing accessibility on the first floor for this year.
- Column at Circulation Desk, cuts off view of front desk from staff
stations. This sometimes leads to slow service for patrons.
♦ Could this column be reduced in size for better visual
access?
- The display cases filled with SPEC items on the first floor by the
genre cubbies do not allow easy access for wheelchair users to go
around them and they block visual access to the MILL.
♦ The recommendation is to move them elsewhere in the
building and put in their place another study table as this
front area is very popular with students.
▪ Campus Safety/building issues: From Samm’s email regarding the last
inspection: “email from Beau and he did let me know that all of the items
form our list from last year had been addressed on the department
level.”
▪ Walkthrough to be conducted at the end of Spring 2025.
▪ Standardized flyers have been created and placed in Share Point by a
previous Spaces Team member.
▪ Blank floor plans have been sent over from facilities. The PSPP team will
update them to reflect the evacuation meet-up point outside of Renfrew.
**➢ Spring Updates:**
▪ Walkthrough of all 4 floors and the Special Collections Offices conducted.
- PSPP Team members split into pairs.
♦ Each pair had a checklist to take notes.
➢ See Share Point for pdf, link below.
▪ 2025_Library.Walk-Thru.Checklist
- Priority items to address:
♦ See Appendix for photos correlating to Priority Items.
♦ Study Booth cushions on first and second floor are used
very often and are ripping at the seams.
➢ There is also one booth (possibly removed for
damage) from 1st floor, southside, facing MILL.
♦ Metallic silver chairs in the living room area show wear.
♦ Purple benches by computer lab on first floor show wear.
♦ Monday morning cleaning rotation. Can we get priority?
➢ Carpet on 4th floor – stains throughout.
➢ Carpet in Renfrew Presentation space.
➢ Carpet by Circulation and Reference area.
➢ Vacuuming beneath booths.
➢ Wiping tables.
➢ Trash throughout all floors.

- Miscellaneous items:
♦ Small wall scrapes and dings.
♦ Air filter replacement in Team Rm 2.
♦ Missing corner guard/corner protector on 4th floor.
♦ Missing glass board tray in Team Rm 2.
♦ Floor signs.
➢ Temporary updates as needed for changes to
floors.
▪ Reference Desk shift to 2nd floor.
▪ Studio moved to 1st floor.
**▪ Possible change:**
- Graphic novels and Travel Guides
moved to 1st floor.
▪ Evacuation Floor Maps.
- Originally going to redo from blank floor maps.
- Victoria Kerr forwarded along revised maps from 2023.
♦ Kelley Moulton edited to show correct meetup position.
- All Evacuation Floor Maps have been replaced on all floors.
**Metrics:**
➢ # of patrons using spaces, including:
▪ Study rooms and graduate carrels.
▪ Public spaces on the 1st – 4th floors.
▪ Metrics will be broken down further for the End-Year Report.
- Full metrics here: Space Count Fall 2024 & SPRING 2025.xlsx
- According to the floor counts conducted by Access Services, Fall
2024 and Spring 2025: These numbers include individual/group
study rooms and open study areas on all 4 floors of the Library.
♦ September = 8,657
♦ October = 15,050
♦ November = 10,578
♦ December = 6,722
♦ January = 9,459
♦ February = 11,629
♦ March = 8,423
♦ April = 11,283
♦ May = 2,355
▪ Data Hub/Map Room.
- Fall 2024 (usage for entire semester)
♦ Count of people using Data Hub w/ Events = 889.
♦ Count of people using Data Hub w/o Events = 614.
- Spring 2025:
♦ Average daily count of Data Hub use w/o Events = 10.

♦ Count of people using Data Hub w/o Events = 823.
➢ Language from Excel sheet shared by Jeremy
Kenyon: space Usage_aggregate Data.xlsx
▪ New data points used rather than those
placed in 2024-25 PSPP Mid Year Report.
▪ GSCC.
- Suzie tracks patrons in the space by an hourly tally sheet which is
used as the Gate Count, so this would be a redundant count.
➢ # of building issues reported.
▪ Discussed creating an excel to track these, however we worried it would
be more work than was necessary.
- Rami Attebury created Auto-populating Excel Sheet to list any
issue that is forwarded along to the lib-bldg email address.
♦ All issues forwarded to UI Facilities will include CC: the lib-
bldg email address starting Fall 2025, so as to populate
Rami’s Excel sheet.
▪ Reached out directly to UI Facilities and they reported back:
- 58 were in response to issues or special requests.
- ## response to issues or special requests.
➢ # of furniture issues identified.
▪ Not available right now, Facilities just reported the number of issues, not
what they were about.
▪ Furniture issues addressed in Spring 2025 walkthroughs:
- 14 booths to replace for student study spaces, 1st and 2nd floors.
♦ 24 booths total in Library, if we want to have all the
booths updated all at once.
- 6 purple benches near 1st floor Living Room space.
- 4 metallic silver chair cushions in 1st floor Living Room space.
▪ See Appendix for all issues and correlating photographic evidence.
➢ Gate count Main and GSCC.
▪ Main: 122,195 (August 18 – December 31, 2024)
▪ GSCC: 924 (August 18 – December 31, 2024)
▪ Main: 129,308 (January 1 – May 10, 2025)
▪ GSCC: 670 (January 1 – May 10, 2025)
● OBJECTIVE #2: Provide oversight for space use related to programming and events, such
as the colloquium series, external workshops, public readings, therapy dogs, tabling, etc.
**➢ Why:**
▪ Ensure the campus community and public patrons have adequate space
to meet their educational needs.
**➢ How:**
▪ Communicate with event organizers and access services staff to
coordinate space reservations and any needed furniture arrangement.

**➢ Success looks like:**
▪ Consistent programming throughout the year that enriches the
educational environment of the campus and public community.
▪ Utilizing attendance metrics to guide programming decisions.
**➢ Fall 2024 Updates:**
▪ When events pop up, the appropriate folks have been looped in, Jylisa,
Alisa, and the PSPP Team Lead. An example of this: when the NASC study
coordinator reached out for repeat reservations for the current semester.
▪ Why we crossed out the final bullet point under “success looks like”
please see note under Metrics for “# of attendees”.
- Programming decisions can be discussed later on with the
Associate Dean, Rami Attebury.
**➢ Spring 2025 Updates:**
▪ Reservations for 1st floor tabling space have been addressed.
- New Microsoft Form for tabling to be implemented Fall 2025.
- Another check to keep track of which student groups/campus
offices use the main UI Library for promotion and/or club
activities. To use in conjunction with Lib Cal.
▪ Renfrew presentation space used for displaying student work from
HIST424.
- Sensing Place: An Environmental History Exhibit.
♦ Photos in Share Point for context.
➢ 05_Sensing.Place_HIST424
**Metrics:**
❖ # of events (Fall 2024)
➢ 17 - Renfrews/Read-Ins.
➢ 25 - ETIL workshops.
➢ 06 - Graduate Student Essentials.
➢ 05 - Data Hub Talks.
➢ 04 - visits from Therapy Dogs.
➢ 02 - student groups tabling.
➢ 59 = total.
❖ # of events (Spring 2025)
➢ 13 - Renfrews/Read-Ins.
➢ 39 ETIL workshops.
➢ 10 - Data Hub Talks (5)/IIDS presentations (5).
➢ 05 - visits from campus offices: Therapy Dogs (4)/Health Hut (1).
➢ 05 - UI affiliated groups tabling.
▪ Taste of Nepal = 8 days.
▪ UI Geology Club = 2 days.
▪ International Programs Office = 1 day.
▪ Study Abroad Office = 2 days.

▪ India Student Organization = 4 days.
➢ 01 - Miscellaneous (presentation on 1st floor).
▪ HIST424: Sensing Place paired with a display of student work.
➢ 73 = total.
➢ # of attendees
▪ There is not an efficient way to do this as not every event is attended
by a PSPP Team Member, so we cannot keep accurate numbers.
**Team/Unit Members:**
- Bruce Godfrey
- Samm Green
- Haley Hunter
- Kelley Moulton
- Tyler Rodrigues
- Rochelle Smith
- Kelly Omodt, Team Lead
**Reporting to:**
- Rami Attebury
**Final Outcomes:**
❖ We’re seeing consistent use of all four floors. Sponsored events seem to be well
attended.
❖ Our study spaces are so well loved by students that we need to replace some furniture.
➢ Mainly booth cushions on 1st and 2nd floors, as well as a few seating areas in the
Living Room on 1st floor.
❖ Our building is so well used it deserves some TLC in return.
➢ Mainly in the form of cleaning – see final point under the next section.
Challenges & Opportunities for Next Year:
❖ A challenge is accurately tracking building issues within the main UI Library, the team
will brainstorm on how to efficiently track these filed issues without being added to the
lib-bldg email list.
➢ With the implementation of Rami’s auto-populated Excel sheet, this issue may
be addressed in the following year.
❖ An opportunity is expanding partnerships across campus and inviting other disciplines to
use the 1st floor presentation space.
➢ The opportunity arose with HIST424 professor, Dr. Kreikemeier, reaching out to
showcase student work along with an opening reception on 1st floor of the main
UI Library, in the Renfrew presentation area, Sensing Place.
▪ This event/exhibit can be used as an example going forward.
❖ Monday Morning Cleaning Rotation from UI Facilities:

➢ Appendix, Figure 3: examples to demonstrate the need of extra cleaning.
▪ Deep clean of the following:
- Carpet on 4th floor – stains throughout.
- Carpet in Renfrew Presentation space.
- Carpet by Circulation and Reference areas.
**▪ Weekly cleaning needs:**
- Vacuuming beneath booths.
- Wiping study tables in all rooms.
- Trash throughout all floors (bathrooms included).
♦ Could the above 3 tasks be completed late Sunday night or
early Monday morning?
➢ It has been noted by several staff and faculty
members that the weekend trash is not emptied by
Monday morning.
➢ The UI Library keeps late hours to foster student
accessibility to resources and overall student
success. Having a clean space adds to the
accessibility and appreciation of our space.

Appendix
Photographs in Order of Prioritized Tasks
Figure 1: Booth Cushions.
Note: Have we always had this booth missing, or was it removed a while ago?
Note: The 8 seat cushions on 2nd floor in worst
conditions were originally on the 1st floor, by public elevator, relocated to 2nd floor in 2021.
Figure 2: Living Room Furniture

Note: Purple benches near computer lab, edges breaking down.
Note: Seat cushions for metallic chairs are cracking, possibly replace only the seats?
Figure 3: Cleanliness

Note: One example of where stains are showing on carpet.
Note: Included to show that the floor beneath the study booths has not been vacuumed.
Figure 4: Walls

Note: This corner wall protector is in the Library Admin Office, Samm Green will be placing a
ticket to fix this in early May, 2025.
Sidenote: The walls on every floor contain scuff marks related to patron use, either from chairs,
shoes, bags, tables, etc. Photos not included but wanted to make the remark that these scuff
marks have been noticed and will keep an eye if they develop into scrapes or cracks, see final
photo under “Figure 5”.
Figure 5: Too small to fix?

Note: titled “too small to fix?” because they are low on the priority list, but I wanted to bring it
to Admin attention just in case; as well as document how many of these small maintenance
issues crop up over an academic year.
Note: Both on 1st floor.

Note: small ding in wall, not quite a hole.
Note: scrape along wall – will sanding and repainting be enough?

**RESEARCH IMPACT TEAM**
**Overview:**
The Research Impact Team enhances the representation and impact of the university's research
endeavors and scholarly communication through its management of VERSO, the university's research
information management and Institutional Repository system, its promotion of university research, and
its efforts to facilitate connections between university researchers.
**Library KPIs:**
- Research Information Management
  - Profiles
  - Research Assets
  - Research Assets by Type
  - Research Output Downloads and Views
- Esploro KPI Dashboard
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Create clear policies and procedures for both public and internal users using VERSO and related
research data workflows
  - Why:
▪ To make it possible for all users to accomplish necessary tasks using up-to-
date information at time of need
  - How:
▪ Develop and disseminate comprehensive, public-facing documentation
to assist users in profile development and system utilization.
▪ Develop and disseminate comprehensive, public-facing policies to
educate users in proper system use and their rights/obligations.
▪ Develop and communicate comprehensive, intra-library documentation
to assist library users in profile development and system utilization.
▪ Develop and communicate comprehensive, intra-library policies to
educate staff in proper system use and user rights/obligations.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Published and up-to-date documentation for internal and public users is
available via a live website.
  - Fall update:
  - Live sites are available for public-facing procedures and policies, as well as internal
procedures. There is not yet a site for internal policies, simply a spreadsheet.
  - Of the preliminary 12 topics identified for internal procedures, 10 have some form of
documentation, covering most short-to-medium-term recurring tasks.

  - There are many open policy questions. The team decides them by drafting ½ - 1 page
policy proposals, discussing them in a quorum, voting on them, and recording the
results in minutes and our policies folder.
  - Currently, public-facing documentation relies a lot on existing Ex Libris tutorials (e.g.,
Adding Output to a Profile). We have not received sufficient feedback from users to
determine whether this is adequate or not.
  - Spring update:
  - The public facing procedures site has been updated. Previously, it included information
about editing profiles and assets. Now it also includes information about exporting
assets and controlling privacy. Links to Ex Libris’ generic Esploro documentation have
also been replaced with VERSO/U of I branded examples. Future topics, such as
adding/changing profile pictures, have been identified.
  - No additional internal procedures have been documented. Additional topics such as
minting DOI’s and markdown best practices have been identified.
  - Policy decisions continue to be made as needed and are recorded in the policies folder.
**Accepted policies include:**
▪ what counts as research which can be submitted to VERSO. Brief summary: FSH
5100 and 1320 jointly define what counts as research for the University. The RI
team policy states we follow the University definitions. Moreover, since VERSO’s
mission is to preserve and provide access to U of I research/creative output the
policy states it is appropriate for VERSO staff to act as stewards and reject non-
research submissions, while acknowledging the importance of subject-matter
expertise and the existence of grey areas.
▪ whether pre-prints ought to be included as research and allowed in VERSO. Brief
summary: yes, as long as they do not become the majority of the content within
VERSO. Pre-prints are an important form of scholarly communication and so
should be included. However, they are not considered authoritative versions of
record and so should not be VERSO’s main focus.
▪ maximum sizes for file submissions. Brief summary: VERSO deposits are limited
to 20GB or less. Larger submissions can have metadata records in VERSO but
must be hosted elsewhere. VERSO staff will assist with external hosting (e.g., by
coordinating with RCDS) if necessary. 20GB was chosen to balance the fact that
(1) VERSO currently has a 3TB storage limit which we don’t want to exceed, but
(2) there is demonstrated interest in using VERSO as a dataset repository and
replacement to RCDS’s DKAN repository; the lower the file size limit the less
helpful VERSO becomes for those users.
▪ preserving/archiving VERSO data. Brief summary: Every six months the RI team
will work with the Digital Lab Manager to ensure a copy of all researcher
metadata, research output metadata, and fulltext documents are stored in the
digital archives folders and linked to relevant special collections. This backs-up

important data, facilitates future re-use or analysis, and ensures the RI team
shares important collections info with SPEC.
Develop and improve institutional repository capabilities for library and internal partners
  - Why:
▪ To take advantage of system capabilities and serve campus needs
  - How:
▪ Build relationships with campus entities that can use our IR capabilities.
▪ Work with Extension to create means for using VERSO as possible
publication venue.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Successfully integrating significant collections and ongoing
collaborations with cross-campus entities, including Extension
▪ Clear policies and documentation developed and published for internal
and public users
  - Fall update:
  - All “active” extension publications in the Pacific Northwest Publication and Extension
Bulletin Series are in VERSO, totaling 287 and 246 outputs, respectively. We have
workflows for ingesting new active publications and are developing workflows to move
inactivated publications from VERSO to a digital collection.
  - We are also working with IIDS to archive as much of their data repository as possible.
We have the workflows to do that but need to make a policy decision on which datasets
are too large to store in VERSO and should instead link out. That collection totals 413
outputs.
  - We have also worked with the Mc Clure Center for Public Policy to ingest their
publications, newsletters, and reports, as well as set up workflows for further
submissions. This totals 130 ouputs.
  - We have automated ingestion of all theses and dissertations (2261 as of 5/19/2025).
  - We have not developed generalized policies and procedures for initiatives like the above
beyond instructing users to contact lib-verso@uidaho.edu. It’s not clear that we can
create generalized workflows at this time. We have not done enough of these
collaborations to anticipate or prescribe how they ought to go.
  - Spring update:
  - VERSO is now the preferred data repository for the U of I. All 413 datasets in IIDS’s
DKAN repository now have records in VERSO. All but the largest datasets have been
moved into VERSO. All future datasets will be represented in VERSO, and any 20GB or
smaller will be hosted in VERSO.
  - The team has worked with RCDS to develop the Collaboration Network, a site
that uses VERSO assets and researcher profiles to make U of I research and
researchers more discoverable. Collaboration Network uses LLMs to summarize
the content of researcher VERSO profiles, match them to a user’s natural

language queries, and serve up relevant researchers and research outputs from
VERSO. Closed beta testing of the Collaboration Network began in Nov 2024. The
RI team continues to work with IIDS in anticipation of a broader release
sometime during FY26.
  - The team is working to scrape the fulltext and metadata of open access UI publications
listed in Open Alex. It is too early for precise estimates, but preliminary data suggests
this could improve or ingest ~1k – 5k assets.
  - The team has also received enhanced metadata for ~8k VERSO assets which IIDS
scraped from Semantic Scholar for their Collab Net. We are working to parse the data,
load it into VERSO, and ensure the process is reversible if necessary.
Ensure Researcher Profiles and Asset presentation is up-to-date and accurate in VERSO
  - Why:
▪ To amplify the research and researchers at the University of Idaho
  - How:
▪ Develop and disseminate prototypes of a variety of possible research
**representing tools including:**
  - Subject or department specific collections
  - Analytics reports
  - visualizations
  - Success looks like:
▪ 95% of profiles accurately portray research of individuals.
▪ Ensure 100% profile coverage for all faculty members.
▪ Attain 85% profile coverage for non-faculty (research staff, post-docs)
researchers.
▪ 1 prototype of each research-representing tool disseminated to 1 or
more departments within each College.
  - Fall update:
▪ Based on information from the Provost’s office, we have profiles for all 770
current UI faculty, as well as an additional 87 miscellaneous profiles for 857
total. Of those, 10 (1.2%) still need biographic information corrected or added.
▪ It’s not clear how to determine whether profiles accurately portray the research
of individuals because there is no single master list. However, we can make
**some relative judgments:**
▪ Of the 857 profiles, 346 (40%) have fewer than 10 outputs. Depending
on the faculty member fewer than 10 may be acceptable but having
fewer outputs reduces the accuracy of VERSO’s automated publication
ingestion.
▪ Of the total 181 communications received from faculty and librarian
liaisons, 23 (13%) mentioned output/metadata issues.

▪ Of the 23,061 assets: 6568 (29%) have abstracts, 15142 (66%) have links
to access the output on the web or provide access to the file directly in
VERSO, and 5195 (23%) are tagged with either research topics or
keywords.
▪ VERSO is best at automatically ingesting STEM outputs. It is moderate
for social sciences and humanities but misses non-traditional scholarly
publications like sculptures or exhibitions completely. We worked to
solicit CV’s and input from humanities scholars but did not receive
enough feedback to create workflows for fixing this gap.
▪ It’s not clear how to determine the population of non-faculty researchers. The
87-non-faculty profiles in VERSO are certainly an underestimate.
▪ Several specialized collections have been developed. One for COGS, two for
CIIRE in EHHS (1, 2), and two for CALS extension (1, 2).
  - Spring update:
▪ The Fall update underestimated the number of profiles needing biographical
info corrections by leaving out researchers with missing education fields. As
such, despite the 10 researchers identified in the Fall being fixed, the Spring
analysis shows 14 of 882 (1.6%) profiles require additional bibliographic info.
▪ We continue to explore how to best measure whether 95% of profiles
accurately portray the research of individuals. The team reached out to a
statistical process control expert in Math/Stats to develop a method of sampling
profile accuracy by comparing profiles to CV’s. However, retrieving up-to-date
CV’s is a challenge. Manually comparing CV’s to VERSO profiles may also be too
labor intensive for the amount of metadata they contain, as well as being
redundant with an existing IIDS project to automatically extract data from CV’s.
Next year's charging document suggests an updated approach.
▪ We also continue to explore how to determine 85% coverage for non-faculty
researchers. The team has found and exported relevant data from People Admin
and Argos, but still needs to process it and work with individual Colleges to
verify we’re interpreting it correctly. Next year’s charging document suggests an
updated approach.
**Final Outcomes:**
The team has had three main directions: developing documentation, making policy decisions, and
improving the quality of VERSO data.
The main challenge for data improvements is difficulty finding comprehensive, accurate records of
researcher publications that we could use as benchmarks. This makes it difficult to assess whether “95%
of profiles accurately portray research of individuals” and whether we have attained “85% of profile
coverage for non-faculty".

Our main successes in this area are:
1. 100% profile coverage of all faculty with 98.4% correct biographical information.
2. Ongoing collaborations with CALS, CNR, COGS, and IIDS to ingest IR materials, totaling 3337 this
year.
The main challenge for developing documentation and policy is the lack of feedback from users. This
makes it difficult to decide which parts of VERSO are intuitive or require documentation, and which
policies are most relevant to users.
Nevertheless, our main successes in this area are:
1. establishing a baseline set of internal documentation explaining procedures for checking asset
metadata quality, researcher profile quality, and managing large chunks of VERSO data.
2. Creating public-facing documentation walking users through editing and adding content to their
profile, managing their privacy settings and when/how to contact the VERSO team,
3. developing and implementing a workflow for making policy decisions at times of need, and
4. performing outreach to campus by presenting to faculty senate, CALS and Co E departments,
holding office hours, and coordinating with liaisons to disseminate VERSO info and
documentation.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
The team’s work ingesting and curating bulk IR deposits has developed the Esploro/programming skills
needed for larger, more data-intensive improvements to VERSO. Based on COAR’s Good Practices for
IR’s, the team identified at least two ways to further improve VERSO’s data:
1. review existing VERSO assets to ensure as many as possible include or link out to the fulltext of
resources.
2. continue to identify and ingest IR materials, such as (1) OA U of I publications listed in Open Alex
but not VERSO, and (2) CDIL projects.
The COAR framework also recommends developing digital preservation plans, which dovetails
with the recently adopted preservation policy. As such, implementing and documenting policy
is another major priority for the upcoming year.
Again, it was a challenge to measure whether “95% of profiles accurately portray research of
individuals” and whether we have attained “85% of profile coverage for non-faculty" by compiling a

master list of researchers and research outputs. Next year the team will attempt to assess accuracy and
coverage by regularly and systematically soliciting user feedback on those issues.
Finally, the team may pursue other opportunities as we are able. These include:
1. Adding a default CC license to the VERSO asset depositor agreement and choosing a
license for reuse of VERSO’s metadata. This would improve our documentation by
providing more detailed info about what rights VERSO researchers retain.
2. Improving the discoverability of VERSO by connecting with third party metadata
discovery services like OAI-PMH, Open DOAR, and others.
3. Developing an OA dashboard summarizing amount and types of OA materials in VERSO.
This could be useful externally to communicate VERSO’s capabilities to stakeholders by
emphasizing the discoverability and access it provides. It could also be used internally to
collaborate with Open Strategies on assessing OA adoption across campus.

Student Employee Development Team, Academic Year 2024-25
Last updated 8/9/2024
**Overview:**
The Student Employee Development Group seeks to provide equitable opportunities for student
employees to gain new knowledge and skills via training, on-the-job experiences, and performance
evaluations. This group ensures standardized hiring and training practices for student employees in all
areas of the library while also making recommendations for student employee pay scales.
**Library Metrics:**
- Student Employment (Primary responsibility)
- Fellowships (Relevant)
**Fall 2024 metrics:**
  - SED Fall 2024 Metrics tracking.xlsx
  - Access Services Estimated Labor Costs Fall 2024.xlsx
  - Student Employee Feedback Fall 2024.xlsx
  - Self Assessment Survey_ How Would You Like To Grow
**Spring 2025 metrics:**

  - Spring 2025 Labor Costs Access Services.xlsx
  - Student Employee Feedback Spring 2025.xlsx
AY 2025 – 2026 Charging Document: SED Report FY25-26 Charging Document.docx
**● Objective:**
○ Ensure that student employee pay is justified within each Library unit
- Why:
  - Treat student workers fairly and as respected and valuable members of the
Library.
- How:
  - Review library funding available for student employees
  - Review pay scales across Library units
  - Take into consideration local wages
- Success looks like:
  - Recruitment and retention of high-quality student workers.
  - Staffing needed student positions while staying within budget.

- Fall Update:
We have continued to utilize the Tier system established by Leadership last year to great
success. This has allowed us to provide raises by encouraging our students to take on greater
responsibility and develop additional skills. This spring we plan to reach out to other units on
campus that employee student workers to determine whether our current pay scale is
comparable to others and if any adjustments need to be made in the next fiscal year.
- Spring Update:
This spring several departments provided raises for both longevity and the acquirement of new
skills/responsibilities. We met with Brittni, Samm and Rami and at present our budget does not
allow for much if any additional increase to the maximum student hourly pay at this time.
Currently work-study opportunities on campus are offering as high as $15/hr. Recruitment of
additional work-study students is a tactic we are hoping to explore this Fall.
- Final Outcomes:
Our student workers are overall very satisfied with their employment as demonstrated by our
high retention as well as their comments in the feedback survey. They would all of course like to
make more money. Our Team met with administration and were informed that we are
currently within the range that we should be. We also reached out to other campus employers,
and we are roughly in the middle in regard to student pay on campus. We were able to provide
several raises (25 in total) this year for longevity and the acquirement of new
skills/responsibilities. This Fall we plan to explore hiring more Work Study students to help
offset some of our budget to hopefully allow the increase of our hourly compensation in the
future.
- Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
Competitive pay is becoming an increasing problem on Campus and locally. While we continue
to be a very coveted place of employment, we have seen an increase in our students taking
positions elsewhere solely due to higher pay. This year we are hoping to hire a greater number
of Work Study recipients with the hope that we will be able to leverage more of our budget for
higher hourly pay. We will also continue to encourage the increase of responsibilities/cross
training to maximize our students time and potential most efficiently.
**● Objective:**
○ Ensure that student employees receive regular feedback on their performance and are
given the opportunity to provide feedback on their supervisors
  - Why:
  - To ensure student workers provide high quality services to patrons.
  - To ensure student workers have the chance to learn on the job and share
their ideas.
  - How:
  - Student employees will be evaluated by their supervisor
  - New student employees will be evaluated every 5 weeks for their first
semester of their employment
  - Continuing employees will be evaluated by their supervisor every 6 months
for the remainder the of their employment

  - Student employees will submit a self-evaluation every six months [asked to
share what they learned and what they want to do better; commenting on
this the next semester]
  - Student employees will have the opportunity to provide feedback on their
supervisors at the end of each semester
  - Success looks like:
  - 100% of student employees will be evaluated by their supervisor
  - 100% of student employees will submit a self-evaluation every six months
  - 100% of student employees will have the opportunity to provide feedback
on their supervisors at the end of each semester
- Fall update
A more formalized evaluation system has proven to be very beneficial in solidifying our training,
making clear our expectations and demonstrating a greater level of support than we have in the
past. This is well reflected in the full retention we have going into spring semester and in the
feedback that the students provided through their feedback survey. This was the first semester
that we have provided an opportunity for self-evaluation. We did not get many responses (7
out of 40) but it is a start. We plan to rework it and perhaps offer it earlier in the semester or
possibly combine it with their 6-month evaluation in some way.
- Spring Update:
We determined that attempting to complete formal evaluations at the end of term was proving
to be difficult and thus adjusted our evaluation timing accordingly. Fall evaluations will now
have a deadline of February, and Spring evaluations will take place by the end of Sept for
returning students. We are hoping that this timing will prove to be more successful. New
students will continue to be evaluated after 5 weeks. Unfortunately, for the feedback and self-
evaluations this semester there was a significant error in Qualtrics that was not discovered until
attempting to extract the data. Fortunately, we were still able to collect the students'
comments regarding their experience, but all self-evaluation data was lost. Comments were
once again very positive overall, with 19 out of 45 students responding.
- Final Outcomes:
Formalized evaluations proved to be a stretch for every unit this year, but we are planning to
experiment with adjustments to the timing and are hoping that this will help facilitate the 100%
completion goal going forward. It was very sad to lose so much data from the surveys this
semester. Going forward, the Qualtrics evaluations will be given more scrutiny before being
distributed, and they will be provided earlier in the semester, so as not to conflict with the
busiest time of the semester. This will hopefully increase the number of responses.
- Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
It proved difficult across units this year to conduct formal evaluations. We intend to persevere
and are hopeful to establish a workflow for this process that is not overly arduous in the coming
year. We recognize the value of these evaluations and look forward to a better approach to
satisfying this objective. If we choose to stick with Qualtrics as our evaluation platform for
feedback and self-assessment, we will be troubleshooting far in advance and releasing the
surveys earlier in the semester.

**● Objective:**
○ Provide student employees with relevant and timely training related to their job duties
- Why:
  - To ensure student workers provide high quality services to patrons.
- How:
  - U of I Library student employees will complete general/overview and unit-
specific Library training modules within one month of starting their
employment, and then on an annual basis
  - Develop mechanism for analysis of students’ experiences with the
general/overview Library training and unit-specific Library training
- Success looks like:
  - High-quality training modules developed and maintained
  - Library student employees have completed training
- Fall Update
We currently have two published training modules:
- Student Employee Development Manual:
https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/studentemployeedevelopment
- Access Services Basics:
https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/accessservicesbasics
This spring we plan to develop a module that highlights each unit's role in supporting the
libraries’ mission, vision, and goals. This will include an overview of each unit, including a brief
history, general workflow, and plans for future development and growth.
- Spring Update:
Unfortunately, our goal proved to be a bit too ambitious for this Spring, but we are hopeful to
begin laying the foundation for these modules this summer and are hopeful that we can fully
manifest this project by the end of Fall at the latest.
- Final Outcomes:
While we intend to create a more robust training system across units, the training systems we
currently have in place have continued to prove highly successful. We have also decided that
training unique to each unit is likely to be more effective, for example the MILL would like to
utilize zines and Qualtrics modules may be of better use at the GSCC.
- Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
This year we were not able to successfully complete individual unit training modules as we had
envisioned at the beginning of Fall. However, throughout the course of the year we were able
to brainstorm approaches that will hopefully prove to be more effective this coming year.
Rather than attempting to design a “one size fits all” we plan to generate unique approaches
best suited to each individual unit.

Student Engagement, Academic Year 2024-25
Last updated 6/11/25
**Overview:**
The Student Engagement Team provides opportunities for students to engage with and learn more
about library staff, resources, campus services, and each other. The team strives to create a sense of
community in which all levels of students feel seen, heard, and comfortable engaging with the library.
They offer in-person events and asynchronous connections by creating non-curricular programming or
by collaborating with others in the campus community who do the same.
**Relevant Library Metrics:**
- Building Usage
- Exhibits
**Objectives:**
- Objective #1:
  - Maximize student awareness of and comfort in library spaces, resources, services,
and staff.
  - Why:
▪ To educate students about services and resources that may benefit their
research, educational, and personal information needs.
▪ To ease anxiety students may have about library resources, staff, or spaces.
▪ Give students opportunities to interact with the library in a both synchronous
and asynchronous way that builds community.
  - How:
▪ Design, market, offer, or participate in engaging non-curricular events that
provide students with an opportunity to learn about library resources, services,
and staff
▪ Identify and collaborate with partners outside of the library to coordinate
similar events.
▪ Create and assessment plan rubric for events and growth
▪ Sketch out key Library events we’d like to do annually and create reoccurring
schedule
  - Success looks like:
▪ Student awareness of library resources, services, and staff members.
▪ Student participation and engagement in events and programs.
▪ Identification and prioritization of key events.
  - Fall Update
▪ 16 successful events were held (up from 12 last fall) with 938 students being
reached (up from 454 last fall, a 206% increase!)
▪ Our whiteboard also saw and uptick in participation
- Our average engagement this fall was 81% as compared to 79% last fall
  - Spring Update
▪ 12 successful events were held with 568 students

- down from 17 last spring, we decided to not attend the Earth Jamm
celebration since the MILL already represented the library. We also had
fewer book club meetings as last spring we did two groups for both
books.
▪ Our whiteboard saw a slight decrease to 79% coverage on average.
- We saw less interaction with the first and last question of the semester
than we did in the fall
▪ Final outcomes
- We see a slight reduction in our engagement opportunities over the
course of this academic year in large part due to some changes made to
our Hit the Book(s) club program and decisions about the efficiency of
outreach opportunities. In the past the library has been represented at
many events by two tables, the general library table and the M.I.L.L. This
year at Earth Jamm it was decided for just the M.I.L.L to attend as the
main attraction. We also had a decrease in other campus events that
were centered around more DEI initiatives that we no longer held. In the
Fall Hit the Book(s) ran two separate meeting times and sessions for
each book whereas in the Spring that only occurred for one book,
making a marked reduction in event metrics there. The very slight
decreases in the engagement with the whiteboard could be just due to
Spring semester fatigue but is something to monitor as we formalize
tracking this metric.
▪ Challenges and opportunities
- Next semester there is already a planned increase in activity due to the
addition of a graduate student book club. Tyler is also setting up
meetings with student housing to reestablish a partnership there for
event opportunities. The team has discussed some potential event
opportunities and plans to implement them in the next coming year as
an aspirational goal.
- Challenges that remain are staffing of tabling events and how to better
leverage student ambassadors. Perhaps the team will try and develop a
more formal path to “booking” student employees as resources.
- Objective #2:
  - Maximize the awareness and use of key or unique library collections.
  - Why:
▪ To highlight library collections that are diverse and engaging and that may not
otherwise be heavily used.
  - How:
▪ Create library displays or work with campus partners to do so.
▪ Include materials from the library’s collection for display.
▪ Cultivate library cubbies genre collection.
▪ Get Board game collection up to current processing standards

  - Success looks like:
▪ Rotating displays in both the Library and GSCC that highlight different print
collections.
▪ Increased circulation of materials via displays.
▪ Rotating participatory displays that let students engage creatively and
constructively with each other.
▪ Utilization of collections from cubbies.
▪ Utilization use of board games collections.
  - Fall Update
▪ We’ve had 5 library partner displays so far; this is a slight decrease from last
year’s 7 partnerships.
- This could be due to the changing nature of offices and programs across
the campus this semester.
- As well as our implementation of a permanent display partnership with
the Frist Generation Student Center.
▪ The big win here comes from our materials checked out from displays, we had
256 checkouts this fall as compared to the 37 from 2023 (a 691% increase!)
- This success comes mainly from implementing out new genre focused
cubby displays.
- We might consider in the future what other more “fun” targeted
shelving we could employ in the library.
▪ Our board game circulation starts for this semester are 248 as compared to 184
last fall (134% increase).
**▪ Metrics:**
- The hit the books website received 821 hits last fall, compared to 822
last fall.
- 155 hits on the common read guide
- 40 qr code hits from the bookmark
- 260 From board game collection builder
  - Spring Update
▪ We’ve had 4 library partner displays which holds steady with last spring.
- Materials that were curated for displays received 9 check outs.
▪ Our Genre cubbies received 106 checkouts
- Down from the first full semester which could be a typical pattern but
this collection is overdue for a refresh and wedding which will occur this
summer as we migrate in the browsing collection.
▪ Our board game circulation received 121 check outs
- This collection is also over-due for an update in organizing and new
materials.
- In April Abby was trained to assist in updating this collection but so far
no work has been completed.
▪ For our marketing materials we saw
- 48 QR code hits from our library bookmark
- 599 hits on the book club libguide
- 569 hits on the common read libguide
- 426 hits on the board game collection builder site

▪ Final outcomes
- We saw a slight increase in interaction with the bookmark even with the
decrease in engagement opportunities which might indicate our fewer
events are still effective. The large growth comes in engagement with
the common read libguide and this is most likely due to the library
strengthening its relationship with the common read program and the
Director of General Education. We also saw a healthy growth in views of
the board game collection site; this could be due in part to the release of
an article on this tool in March. Check outs from both the board games
and genre cubbies fell between fall and spring, this is mostly likely due to
both collections being past due for a refresh. We have dissolved the
browsing collection and merged that with the genre cubbies, which
could lead to an increase next AY.
▪ Challanges and Opportunities
- This biggest challenge here is the lack of time and manpower to make
updates and changes for the board game collection. This summer we
hope to get some work done in this area and are hopeful that with the
addition of Abby the board game collection may get some much-needed
help. There is also an opportunity to refresh some of our flyer marketing
materials as well as seek out new engagement partners.
- Objective #3:
  - Ensure that engagement programing follows national trends and best
practices as well as aligns with the library’s mission and goals.
- Why:
  - To help identify specific opportunities that will maximize student engagement
without overburdening library staff.
- How:
  - Conduct and compile a literature review on the areas of student engagement
we are currently involved in to formalize our work.
  - Develop a mechanism for assessment of our programing and timeline for
assessment to occur.
- Fall Update
  - We have not made any progress towards this goal as we have focused on the
other areas of development in the last few semesters.
- The hope is to analyze the 12 articles that have been collected for
growth and develop a program for assessment summer 25
- We have presented on our programs and been accepted for publication
on our board game collection but there is still a necessity for assessment
and growth plan to be created.
- Spring update
  - A literature review focused on book clubs in academic libraries is currently being
conducted by Tyler in preparation for an ACRL book focused on this area of service
  - Tyler went to ACRL in April and participated in 3 round tables focused on book clubs

- A meeting of 7 other librarians across the nation was held to inform them on
how the university of Idaho book club started and is run
- An Editor from C&RL reached out to Tyler to solicit an article on this work as
well
- Final outcomes
  - This academic year a lot of time and effort has been spent on changes to event
planning and engagement, as well as our main workforce being pulled into other
projects which has not allowed for much assessment past basic student head counts
and observational data. We have since had a large increase in scholarship
opportunities that we hope to capitalize on in the next few years.
- Challenges and opportunities
  - Since this work is tied mainly to one individual that is the only tenure track
faculty member on the team, it might be considered to remove this objective from
the team document. While there is progress and opportunities for this work and
growth in this area, it remains a difficult metric to assess in this formalized way.

LIBRARY WEBSITE TEAM 2024-25 Overview Document
**Overview:**
The Library Website Team works to create, maintain, and improve the Library’s main website and
related digital platforms. It supports developing expertise, assessment, and vision across the Library to
ensure the Library’s web properties are focused on user needs and accessible to all.
- 2024-25 meeting notes, website team meetings 2024-25.docx
**Library KPIs:**
- Course Reserves
- Digital Collections
- Electronic Resources
- Geographic Information Systems
- Online Catalog
- Physical Circulation
- Research Information Management
- Web Properties (Primary)
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Improve discoverability of library content
- Why:
  - The Library website content needs streamlining
- How:
  - Assess which pages are needed and which can be removed
  - Simplify menus and navigation
  - Incorporate newly designed instruction resources pages into site
  - Measure and assess website usage through analytics
- Success looks like:
  - The website is significantly revised and analytics demonstrates improved user navigation
and discoverability of content.
- Fall Update:

  - The team did a full review of all content linked to from the navigation (see third
objective notes)--findings suggested several areas for simple improvements at
simplifying page structure which were immediately implemented.
  - For the longer-term goal, the team has been gathering sources of data about the
existing site (pages and analytics) and best practices and examples in our “notes on
information redesign”. The review is helping us understand the breadth of content as
we discuss how to start the large project of redesign.
  - Significant work (mainly from Weymouth and Becker) went into developing Analytics
dashboards to make data about the web properties more easily accessible. Team
members led a library wide workshop to introduce people to the Analytics data and how
it can be used.
- Spring Update:
  - Following up on full review, significant work was done updating content and some
reorganization of navigation.
  - Research continued in to redesign strategies and ways to gather feedback.
  - Collaborated with Discovery Team on reviewing and tweaking all search boxes on the
website for improved consistency.
Redesign website to match university web branding revisions
- Why:
  - The Library website needs to maintain design connections with the main university
website
- How:
  - Once new design is released for main university site, use the team to re-design and
deploy a new look for the library website.
- Success looks like:
  - A re-designed website aligned with university revisions.
- Fall Update:
  - The university redesign is still in process, so library redesign is still on hold.
  - The library website was updated to use Bootstrap 5 and other updated assets which
should help streamline future redesign process.
  - The team has been doing research into best practices and examples to draw from.
- Spring Update:
  - Still in holding pattern...
Provide up to date communication and information on the website
- Why:

  - The Library website users should feel confident they are receiving accurate and up-to-
date information.
- How:
  - Improve communication options, including developing new front page features, on the
website for regular updates to provide a feed of fresh information and highlights of the
library's work.
  - Establish unit web coordinator contacts to ensure each area's information is kept up to
date.
- Success looks like:
  - The library website is up to date in all areas and useful to users looking for current
information about library events and resources.
- Fall Update:
  - The team reviewed all content that is listed in our navigation to ensure all content is up
to date. A review checklist describes the aims and spreadsheet contains the notes. The
team contacted people across the library to follow up on questions and get fresh
information. Numerous out of date pages were revised, reorganized, or removed.
**Specific updates of note:**
▪ New tutorial sections were added to Find Articles and Books to help support
user needs. VERSO documentation added.
▪ Refresh of Spec section to simplify and remove unmaintained content.
▪ Remove old “Towers” and replace with “Letters from the Library”.
▪ Updated topbar “Hours” to directly pull information from Lib Cal Hours, allowing
users to update hours and add alert messages immediately (for unexpected
closures etc).
▪ Refresh content in Open, OAPF, and Studio.
  - The web project on Git Hub received commits from 11 contributors over this period,
including 4 new contributors. This strong group of contributors highlights growing skills
and confidence in multiple areas of the library to directly contribute to the website.
- Spring Update:
  - Regular updates continued, with Maryelizabeth taking on the lead for deploying new
content. Timely features, such as a banner for Vandal Giving Day or fellowship openings,
were added to support Library initiatives.
  - The web project on Git Hub received 100 commits from 9 contributors during this
period, showing significant regular updates and a strong group of contributors.
  - Work was done to migrate content from old webpages server.
**Unit/Team Metrics:**
▪ % of pages reviewed by coordinators for accuracy
  - Fall: 100% of pages in navigation
▪ Web engagement statistics (as determined by team lead after evaluation)

▪ # of commits to redesign project on Git Hub
  - Fall: no commits on a new redesign yet. Work on assets update and content updates will
contribute to future project. 215 commits on current website project from 11 different
contributors.
  - Spring: no commits on a new redesign yet. 100 commits on current project from 9
contributors.
▪ Web traffic between properties and main university website
▪ % of web properties with updated library branding
  - Fall: update to Digital home page and digital collection templates brings better library
branding to those areas.
▪ Timeliness assessment for each unit – survey of unit members asking if website up-to-date
  - Fall: no survey done.
Final Outcomes 2024-25
In 2024-25 the Library Website Team has continued to develop internal skills that contribute to
sustainably maintaining a useful and useable library website. New Digital Projects Manager,
Maryelizabeth Koepele, quickly learned the workflows and infrastructure to take over as the primary
contact point to deploy regular updates to the website. Other new members learned how to navigate
the project and directly contribute, adding 4 new contributors this year who created materials such as
documentation and tutorials, in addition to updates to existing content.
Overall, we have been in a frustrating holding pattern waiting for the main university website redesign
with little communication from their team to help us understand what it will be like. Without a clear
idea of the basic pattern of their redesign, it has been difficult to imagine how our site can be
redesigned and reorganized in a way that will mirror their look and feel. The team reviewed our existing
content and made some minor reorganizations, but is stalled in a larger vision for the major project of
redesigning our site and content.
**Reflection on 2024-25 objectives:**
- Improve discoverability of library content
  - As part of the complete content review, numerous small changes were made to
clarify information and organization across the site.
  - We have been researching other sites, guidelines, and methods for gathering
feedback about library websites.
- Redesign website to match university web branding revisions
  - In holding pattern, although some work has been done to assets that should help
streamline future migration.
- Provide up to date communication and information on the website

  - The team reviewed 100% of the content listed in our navigation. Dozens of
updates were made, old content removed, broken links updated, and
organization tweaked.
  - The “Library Updates” page was regularly updated with content such as digital
collection launches, new publishing agreements, and fellowship opportunities.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
The current objectives will continue to guide work in 2025-26. Managing the redesign project will be a
major challenge (and opportunity) with the Library Website Team next year. Redesigning the website is
an opportunity to rearticulate how we communicate about the Library, but is also limited by many
constraints and requirements. We will need to balance getting meaningful feedback from the library and
stakeholders with directly actionable decision making that will support quick timelines and the complex
context of existing content. The team will need to involve many people across the library on content
work, and receive support from leadership to make key decisions on the top-level strategies.
