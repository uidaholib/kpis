Mar Com Team
**Overview:**
The Marketing & Communications Team ensures consistent, coordinated, and professional
messaging from the Library to the wider university and general public about Library collections,
events, and services with the goal of increasing awareness and use of Library offerings.
**Library KPIs:**
- Relevant
  - Building Usage
  - Course Reserves
  - Digital Collections
  - Electronic Resources
  - Exhibits
  - Fellowships
  - Geographic Information Systems
  - Instruction
  - Physical Circulation
  - Research and Reference Assistance
  - Research Information Management
  - Special Collections & Archives
  - Student Savings
  - Web Properties
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
- Finish formalizing Mar Com processes.
  - Why:
▪ Ensure that users know about Library offerings in a timely way.
▪ Save staff and faculty time.
▪ Reduce confusion and redundant work.
  - How:
▪ Create, refine, and communicate to entire library
▪ Document fully in Library Annual Manual.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Consistent use of processes throughout Library.
**Final Outcomes**
A form for submitting marketing and communications requests was created
(https://tinyurl.com/Library Mar Com) and distributed to the Library; usage has been low, with about
twelve submissions. Continuing to remind people about this form/process will be important.
- Hire a student employee to help with social media accounts and possibly other marketing and
communication activities.
  - Why:
▪ Have more of a student voice in our marketing and communication efforts.

▪ Ensure consistent marketing and communication efforts.
▪ Lessen the burden on fulltime Library employees.
  - How:
▪ Hire a student in the fall
▪ Determine an appropriate scope and amount of work
▪ Document processes and expectations
  - Success looks like:
▪ A successful hire and a clear position description and set of goals that can be
used from year to year.
**Final Outcomes**
We hired a student and had success with him contributing to social media and working with our
templates. Though we gave him space to pursue his own marketing ideas, he didn’t end up
producing anything. It’s unclear if this is due to position description, expectations, or the
motivation of the individual in that position. Overall, this position was a success and could be
further developed to be more successful in the coming years.
- Continue distributing and improving “Letters from the Library.”
  - Why:
▪ Ensure that users know about Library offerings in a timely way.
  - How:
▪ Continue coordinating content and distribution using established processes.
  - Success looks like:
▪ Increasing newsletter usage statistics.
**Final Outcomes**
We published a total of eight monthly newsletters, though we only received statistics for five. The
table below shows a slight increase in our final newsletter, though this is not part of a sustained
trendline. These numbers give us a baseline to try and improve on next year.

**Final Outcomes**

engagement in the second half of the year.
