Student Employee Development Team, Academic Year 2024-25
Last updated 8/9/2024
**Overview:**
The Student Employee Development Group seeks to provide equitable opportunities for student
employees to gain new knowledge and skills via training, on-the-job experiences, and performance
evaluations. This group ensures standardized hiring and training practices for student employees in all
areas of the library while also making recommendations for student employee pay scales.

**● Objective:**
○ Ensure that student employee pay is justified within each Library unit
- Why:
  - Treat student workers fairly and as respected and valuable members of the
Library.
- How:
  - Review library funding available for student employees
  - Review pay scales across Library units
  - Take into consideration local wages
- Success looks like:
  - Recruitment and retention of high-quality student workers.
  - Staffing needed student positions while staying within budget.

- Fall Update:
We have continued to utilize the Tier system established by Leadership last year to great
success. This has allowed us to provide raises by encouraging our students to take on greater
responsibility and develop additional skills. This spring we plan to reach out to other units on
campus that employee student workers to determine whether our current pay scale is
comparable to others and if any adjustments need to be made in the next fiscal year.
- Spring Update:
This spring several departments provided raises for both longevity and the acquirement of new
skills/responsibilities. We met with Brittni, Samm and Rami and at present our budget does not
allow for much if any additional increase to the maximum student hourly pay at this time.
Currently work-study opportunities on campus are offering as high as $15/hr. Recruitment of
additional work-study students is a tactic we are hoping to explore this Fall.
- Final Outcomes:
Our student workers are overall very satisfied with their employment as demonstrated by our
high retention as well as their comments in the feedback survey. They would all of course like to
make more money. Our Team met with administration and were informed that we are
currently within the range that we should be. We also reached out to other campus employers,
and we are roughly in the middle in regard to student pay on campus. We were able to provide
several raises (25 in total) this year for longevity and the acquirement of new
skills/responsibilities. This Fall we plan to explore hiring more Work Study students to help
offset some of our budget to hopefully allow the increase of our hourly compensation in the
future.
- Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
Competitive pay is becoming an increasing problem on Campus and locally. While we continue
to be a very coveted place of employment, we have seen an increase in our students taking
positions elsewhere solely due to higher pay. This year we are hoping to hire a greater number
of Work Study recipients with the hope that we will be able to leverage more of our budget for
higher hourly pay. We will also continue to encourage the increase of responsibilities/cross
training to maximize our students time and potential most efficiently.
**● Objective:**
○ Ensure that student employees receive regular feedback on their performance and are
given the opportunity to provide feedback on their supervisors
  - Why:
  - To ensure student workers provide high quality services to patrons.
  - To ensure student workers have the chance to learn on the job and share
their ideas.
  - How:
  - Student employees will be evaluated by their supervisor
  - New student employees will be evaluated every 5 weeks for their first
semester of their employment
  - Continuing employees will be evaluated by their supervisor every 6 months
for the remainder the of their employment

  - Student employees will submit a self-evaluation every six months [asked to
share what they learned and what they want to do better; commenting on
this the next semester]
  - Student employees will have the opportunity to provide feedback on their
supervisors at the end of each semester
  - Success looks like:
  - 100% of student employees will be evaluated by their supervisor
  - 100% of student employees will submit a self-evaluation every six months
  - 100% of student employees will have the opportunity to provide feedback
on their supervisors at the end of each semester
- Fall update
A more formalized evaluation system has proven to be very beneficial in solidifying our training,
making clear our expectations and demonstrating a greater level of support than we have in the
past. This is well reflected in the full retention we have going into spring semester and in the
feedback that the students provided through their feedback survey. This was the first semester
that we have provided an opportunity for self-evaluation. We did not get many responses (7
out of 40) but it is a start. We plan to rework it and perhaps offer it earlier in the semester or
possibly combine it with their 6-month evaluation in some way.
- Spring Update:
We determined that attempting to complete formal evaluations at the end of term was proving
to be difficult and thus adjusted our evaluation timing accordingly. Fall evaluations will now
have a deadline of February, and Spring evaluations will take place by the end of Sept for
returning students. We are hoping that this timing will prove to be more successful. New
students will continue to be evaluated after 5 weeks. Unfortunately, for the feedback and self-
evaluations this semester there was a significant error in Qualtrics that was not discovered until
attempting to extract the data. Fortunately, we were still able to collect the students'
comments regarding their experience, but all self-evaluation data was lost. Comments were
once again very positive overall, with 19 out of 45 students responding.
- Final Outcomes:
Formalized evaluations proved to be a stretch for every unit this year, but we are planning to
experiment with adjustments to the timing and are hoping that this will help facilitate the 100%
completion goal going forward. It was very sad to lose so much data from the surveys this
semester. Going forward, the Qualtrics evaluations will be given more scrutiny before being
distributed, and they will be provided earlier in the semester, so as not to conflict with the
busiest time of the semester. This will hopefully increase the number of responses.
- Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
It proved difficult across units this year to conduct formal evaluations. We intend to persevere
and are hopeful to establish a workflow for this process that is not overly arduous in the coming
year. We recognize the value of these evaluations and look forward to a better approach to
satisfying this objective. If we choose to stick with Qualtrics as our evaluation platform for
feedback and self-assessment, we will be troubleshooting far in advance and releasing the
surveys earlier in the semester.

**● Objective:**
○ Provide student employees with relevant and timely training related to their job duties
- Why:
  - To ensure student workers provide high quality services to patrons.
- How:
  - U of I Library student employees will complete general/overview and unit-
specific Library training modules within one month of starting their
employment, and then on an annual basis
  - Develop mechanism for analysis of students’ experiences with the
general/overview Library training and unit-specific Library training
- Success looks like:
  - High-quality training modules developed and maintained
  - Library student employees have completed training
- Fall Update
We currently have two published training modules:
- Student Employee Development Manual:
https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/studentemployeedevelopment
- Access Services Basics:
https://uidaho.pressbooks.pub/accessservicesbasics
This spring we plan to develop a module that highlights each unit's role in supporting the
libraries’ mission, vision, and goals. This will include an overview of each unit, including a brief
history, general workflow, and plans for future development and growth.
- Spring Update:
Unfortunately, our goal proved to be a bit too ambitious for this Spring, but we are hopeful to
begin laying the foundation for these modules this summer and are hopeful that we can fully
manifest this project by the end of Fall at the latest.
- Final Outcomes:
While we intend to create a more robust training system across units, the training systems we
currently have in place have continued to prove highly successful. We have also decided that
training unique to each unit is likely to be more effective, for example the MILL would like to
utilize zines and Qualtrics modules may be of better use at the GSCC.
- Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year:
This year we were not able to successfully complete individual unit training modules as we had
envisioned at the beginning of Fall. However, throughout the course of the year we were able
to brainstorm approaches that will hopefully prove to be more effective this coming year.
Rather than attempting to design a “one size fits all” we plan to generate unique approaches
best suited to each individual unit.
