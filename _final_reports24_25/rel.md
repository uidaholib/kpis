Research & Experiential Learning Unit
**Overview:**
The Research & Experiential Learning (REL) offers dedicated spaces and services to U of I
students, staff, and faculty to engage in curricular, research, or personal learning experiences.
The REL Unit delivers services through four programs: the MILL, the Studio, the Data Hub, and
VERSO. Unit personnel emphasizes excellence in service delivery, creative and innovative
learning opportunities, and efficient management of its resources in support of the Library’s
strategic priorities.
**Library KPIs:**
- Geographic Information Systems
  - Usage via unique logins, # of items created, collections purchased

  - MILL door counts exhibited an increase from 12650 in Fall 2024 vs. 9986 in Fall
2023. Annually, 2024 had higher door counts than 2023.
  - Data Hub space usage (numbers of people observed during staffed times) was at
its peak in Fall 2024 with an average of 9.3 people per day, up from 8.2 people in
Fall 2023. The desk saw 79 questions asked, compared to 34 the previous Fall
semester.
  - Studio bookings were 141, which is down from 228 in Spring 24, but up from 104
in the Fall 23. We suspect a cyclical pattern with high spring usage and lower fall
usage. Likewise, the hours the Studio was in use per week was 13, up from
10.75 in Fall 23, but down from Spring 24, which was 22.9 hours per week.
- Spring Update1:
  - MILL door counts were slightly down from Fall 2024 (12650 people) to 11532 in
Spring 2025. However, the Spring 2025 numbers were up from the previous
Spring 2024 (8649) or Spring 2023 (9978).
  - Data Hub space usage was consistent with the Fall 2024. In spring 2025, we
recorded approximately 10 people per day on average during our staffed shifts
(not including event participation). This is very modestly improved on Fall 2024
(9.3), and greatly improved on Spring 2024 (6.7). Interestingly, the Access
Services review of the space (recorded differently than us) yielded about 217.6
people per month, which when measured similarly is pretty consistent. The desk
saw 33 questions, compared to the previous Spring 2024 of 45 questions.
  - Studio bookings were 213, which is down from 228 in Spring 24, but up from 141
in the Fall 24. The hours the Studio was in use per week was 21, up from 13 in
Fall 24, but down from Spring 24, which was 22.9 hours per week.
Create effective learning and research experiences
- Why:
  - To advance information and digital literacy while improving student and
patron capacity to utilize a range of tools
- How:
  - Producing instructional resources that allow asynchronous learning
  - Developing workshops and learning events led by experts
  - Providing services that support the curriculum directly
  - Promoting the resources, workshops, events, and services offered across
campus
- Success looks like:
  - Consistent, well-attended workshops and events
  - Course/class engagement with REL programs
  - Research lab/group engagement with REL programs
- Fall Update
1 I edited the Fall 2024 Data Hub numbers to be our “Avg People w/o events” count of 9.3, which is
different than the previously reported number of 12, which was the Fall 2024 “Avg People w/ events”. This
is because we started counting differently in 2025 and the Avg People w/ Events number is discontinued,
so there is now no comparison. Now the Fall and Spring use the same number.

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
  - Data Hub Tech Talks declined this semester, both in numbers of talks given
and in terms of attendance vs. Spring 2024.
  - MILL Workshops exhibited a decline in overall attendees from the of Fall
2023, but an increase in attendance vs the spring 2024. The trend of annual
attendance (spring + fall) is still increasing.
  - Course and class engagement continued.
▪ The Data Hub continued to be used by VTD 254, scheduled almost
weekly throughout the semester. ENVS 497 and GEOG 385 had students
visit us for help.
▪ The MILL has several classes that work with it, including GERM 301,
FOR 274, SPAN 306, and several campus groups.
▪ The Studio engaged the School of Music directly, receiving feedback for
enhancing the space for their use and is used frequently for coursework.
- Spring Update:
  - Data Hub Tech Talks were held similarly with the Fall 2024, with 5 talks.
Total, mean, and median attendees were down slightly from 43/8.6/7 to
38/7.6/5 respectively.
  - MILL workshops grew in both number and attendance in Spring 2025, with
168 attendees in Spring 2025 vs. 136 in Fall 2024 or 98 in Spring 2024. This
is partly due to 2 more workshops than the previous two semesters. Average
attendance was about 18.6 in Spring 2025, compared to 19.4 in Fall 2024
and 14 in Spring 2024.
  - Course and Class engagement continued:
▪ Studio: About half of the bookings were class-related. The School of
Music faculty have also requested new software (Logic Pro) installed and
reserved the space for class use. For example, Prof. Dylan Champagne
and Prof. Corbin Hohstadt have reserved the space 12 and one time,
respectively.
▪ The MILL interacts with several classes, including GERM 301, SOC404,
SPAN 409 and several campus groups and individual students.
▪ The Data Hub was used by VTD 254 again repeatedly throughout the
semester. IIDS began using the Data Hub frequently for its various
gatherings and brown bags. The Computer Science department began to
use the Data Hub as a location to deliver its CSAC – computer science
course assistance.
Manage research information and data collections efficiently and effectively
- Why:
  - To support university and library goals of tracking and promoting university-
generated research outputs
  - To provide long-term, persistent, public archival support for university research
information, including data and document deposits
- How:
  - Provide support for research data management through data management plan
assistance

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
  - Provide support for geospatial resources and services through the management
of Arc GIS resources and platforms
  - Manage information streams through Esploro/VERSO
  - Work with the DSOS Unit and relevant teams to ensure the repository functions
of Esploro/VERSO function well
- Success looks like:
  - Continued high use of Arc GIS platforms
  - Consistent updating of VERSO
  - Engagement by at least one unit from each UI College with VERSO
  - Use of data management support meeting or exceeding previous performance
- Fall Update
  - GIS platforms continue to exhibit strong use patterns. Fall 2024 (August-
December) unique users averaged 492 per month vs. 422 per month in Fall
2023.
  - VERSO was continually updated throughout the fall, with Research Impacts
Team members managing smart harvesting and the acquisition of several larger
collections of content, namely UI Extension bulletins and the RCDS data
repository.
  - Based on Analytics reports (Esploro Updates - 2024), there is widespread
updating of profile information. The reports make it difficult to verify but virtually
all colleges appear to represented there.
  - Data management support (in the form of DMP consultations was down in 2024
from 2023), however, there appeared to be more RDM-related questions at the
Data Hub than in previous semesters.
- Spring Update:
  - GIS platforms are doing well. We saw approx. 552 unique users per month in
Spring 2025 compared to 492 per month in Fall 2024 or 443 per month in Spring
2024.
  - VERSO was continually updated throughout the spring. The RCDS data
collection was completed in Spring 2025 and regular updates and patron
deposits continued to occur.
  - Data management support continued on the same lines as the Fall 2024, with
about 3 formal consultations.
Revamp the “License to MILL” program (2024-2025 project)
- Why:
  - To create a system of validation/credentialing for students that have
learned how to use various MILL equipment
- How:
  - Refresh the tracking document for the current MILL equipment and
services
  - Establish a tracking tool internally for the MILL manager
- Success Looks Like:
  - A small number of students starting the program each semester
  - 100% completion by a subset of those students

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
  - Promotion of achievement through the MILL’s communication channels
- Fall Update
  - The MILL Manager has started to outline the new achievements for the
License to MILL program. We have not yet formalized the changes yet.
- Spring Update
  - The tracking document has been revamped/refreshed with updated
information for the current capabilities of the MILL. Likewise, the tracking
tool for internal use is prepared. We should be ready for the program in
the Fall 2025.

**Final Outcomes**
In all, 2024-2025 was a year of transition for multiple programs within REL. The MILL’s
renovation was completed in the Fall and set up a great year with traffic up in this year, far
beyond the 2023-2024 academic year. Workshops were also improved with an increase in
workshops and an increase in attendance, including new records. The Studio followed suit with
a major renovation – still ongoing – and a move to the first floor. We have initiated some new
partnerships with Music, longer hours, and have new software and new resources available to
students. We’ve seen bookings keep their pattern of higher in the Spring than the Fall, but with
a minor decline against the previous year. We feel the completion of the renovation might help
change that.
The Data Hub also saw mixed results, with an increase in general space usage, especially
studying and research-related use. However, we’ve seen a decrease in questions asked – with
some regular patrons shifting to individual consultation after coming to the desk, and a decrease
in the attendance of the Tech Talks. Both will require reflection for the next year. GIS platform
and collection use continues to be strong, with higher unique users counts than the previous
year. Finally, the VERSO program has had its first full year in production, with a permanent
Research Information Coordinator in place throughout the year. The results are difficult to judge
as there are not prior years against which to compare, but we achieved our goals and projects
for adding and improving content in the system and the result is a more robust institutional
repository than a year ago.
**Accomplishments include:**
- More than 50% of patrons to the MILL require assistance and the MILL has over 1500
recorded visitors per semester (using our sign-in sheet). MILL staff and students handled
each and every request for help.
- The Mobile MILL has never been more successful at reaching out to students through
events. REL staff and faculty also successfully shared success with the Mobile MILL in
an international conference.
- The MILL directly supported a number of class and research projects. We also continued
our partnership with the Fortunato Lab to 3D print nontoxic parts that can be used in wet
laboratory experiments. We worked with a CNR team to create plot flags for use in the

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
Arboretum. Students produced exhibit material for art shows, created replicas of real-
world objects like the Chernobyl dome, and resources for hydroponics projects.
- Successful re-envisioning of the Studio by library faculty. We made clear choices
regarding items to keep and grow – podcasting facilities – and items to remove – the
e Glass equipment. While not yet complete, our traffic is on par with previous semesters.
- Successfully formed a partnership with Music to build the Studio’s support for their
Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) courses.
- The Data Hub combined with the Computer Science Assistance Center (CSAC) this
year. This involved the introduction of staff and student work space and equipment, as
well as new signage in the library.
- Successfully built a relationship with IIDS to host more of their networking, fellows, and
AI events in the Data Hub space.
- VERSO collections have grown. We have successfully added the current UI Extension
documents and taken over the data repository role from ORED and imported their
previous collection.
- VERSO profiles and metadata are also more robust. We have successfully cleaned and
improved profiles from every college and research unit in the university and are
successfully managing the flow of deposits from researchers and harvest from our
automated harvesters.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
**Challenges:**
- The current Studio space lacks substantial soundproofing, which has resulted in
occasional noise leakage. In some instances, patrons playing loud music prompted
noise complaints from nearby areas. To mitigate this, we needed to develop a stronger
response to both recording noise complaints and enforcing the rules, which entails
documenting the issues and contacting the offending patrons. Thus far, it appears to be
working.
- In all three patron-facing programs, there are continuing challenges in reaching out to
faculty, building relationships, and growing volume of the service. In each case, we have
several programs that work with us, but the potential ceiling (how many partnerships we
have) is much higher than we have likely been able to attain.
- The Data Hub, specifically, hasn’t been able to grow its question base consistently. We
have ebbs and flows, without strong or consistent engagement. While other libraries
have similar services, it is tough to know what the necessary factors are that we are
possibly missing. For the staff who work the desk, the question is whether working a shift
diminishes productivity. If so, we may need to rethink the time spent on the desk.
- The Tech Talks have proven to be a tough nut to crack. We have seen talk attendance
be inconsistent, but also willingness to give talks. The only consistent thread is AI tech
talks have been popular. Remains to be seen what the best approach is.
**Opportunities:**

Created: 8/8/2024, Last Updated: 6/08/2025
- The completion of the Studio’s renovation promises to enable a wide range of services
depending on patron interest. With significant investment, we will have made a much
better podcasting and audio production facility than elsewhere on campus. There is
tremendous opportunity to turn this into a high-volume service.
- The growth and adjustment of our staff and faculty’s activities in support of REL
programs offer opportunities as well. Everyone in the unit will have been in place for over
a year, each unit will be supported by multiple personnel, and they know their areas of
responsibility and will be prepared to deliver for the unit.
- MILL workshops have not been formally documented and their learning outcomes not
yet tied to library literacies or other broader outcomes. We have created some resources
to begin this process and will result in improved pedagogical support for workshop
activities.
- We have seen a few examples of students benefitting from our PCs in the Data Hub,
especially to train geoprocessing models requiring the hardware of the PC. These often
can take days and the students have few other options. This may be an area of growth.
- With the “License to MILL” program ready – we have an opportunity to revisit gamify-ing
the process of learning creative technology skills. While we will need to market the
program, it may be an area of positive engagement with students.
