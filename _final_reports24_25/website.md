LIBRARY WEBSITE TEAM 2024-25 Overview Document
**Overview:**
The Library Website Team works to create, maintain, and improve the Library’s main website and
related digital platforms. It supports developing expertise, assessment, and vision across the Library to
ensure the Library’s web properties are focused on user needs and accessible to all.
- 2024-25 meeting notes, website team meetings 2024-25.docx
**Library KPIs:**
- Course Reserves
- Digital Collections
- Electronic Resources
- Geographic Information Systems
- Online Catalog
- Physical Circulation
- Research Information Management
- Web Properties (Primary)
Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Improve discoverability of library content
- Why:
  - The Library website content needs streamlining
- How:
  - Assess which pages are needed and which can be removed
  - Simplify menus and navigation
  - Incorporate newly designed instruction resources pages into site
  - Measure and assess website usage through analytics
- Success looks like:
  - The website is significantly revised and analytics demonstrates improved user navigation
and discoverability of content.
- Fall Update:

  - The team did a full review of all content linked to from the navigation (see third
objective notes)--findings suggested several areas for simple improvements at
simplifying page structure which were immediately implemented.
  - For the longer-term goal, the team has been gathering sources of data about the
existing site (pages and analytics) and best practices and examples in our “notes on
information redesign”. The review is helping us understand the breadth of content as
we discuss how to start the large project of redesign.
  - Significant work (mainly from Weymouth and Becker) went into developing Analytics
dashboards to make data about the web properties more easily accessible. Team
members led a library wide workshop to introduce people to the Analytics data and how
it can be used.
- Spring Update:
  - Following up on full review, significant work was done updating content and some
reorganization of navigation.
  - Research continued in to redesign strategies and ways to gather feedback.
  - Collaborated with Discovery Team on reviewing and tweaking all search boxes on the
website for improved consistency.
Redesign website to match university web branding revisions
- Why:
  - The Library website needs to maintain design connections with the main university
website
- How:
  - Once new design is released for main university site, use the team to re-design and
deploy a new look for the library website.
- Success looks like:
  - A re-designed website aligned with university revisions.
- Fall Update:
  - The university redesign is still in process, so library redesign is still on hold.
  - The library website was updated to use Bootstrap 5 and other updated assets which
should help streamline future redesign process.
  - The team has been doing research into best practices and examples to draw from.
- Spring Update:
  - Still in holding pattern...
Provide up to date communication and information on the website
- Why:

  - The Library website users should feel confident they are receiving accurate and up-to-
date information.
- How:
  - Improve communication options, including developing new front page features, on the
website for regular updates to provide a feed of fresh information and highlights of the
library's work.
  - Establish unit web coordinator contacts to ensure each area's information is kept up to
date.
- Success looks like:
  - The library website is up to date in all areas and useful to users looking for current
information about library events and resources.
- Fall Update:
  - The team reviewed all content that is listed in our navigation to ensure all content is up
to date. A review checklist describes the aims and spreadsheet contains the notes. The
team contacted people across the library to follow up on questions and get fresh
information. Numerous out of date pages were revised, reorganized, or removed.
**Specific updates of note:**
▪ New tutorial sections were added to Find Articles and Books to help support
user needs. VERSO documentation added.
▪ Refresh of Spec section to simplify and remove unmaintained content.
▪ Remove old “Towers” and replace with “Letters from the Library”.
▪ Updated topbar “Hours” to directly pull information from Lib Cal Hours, allowing
users to update hours and add alert messages immediately (for unexpected
closures etc).
▪ Refresh content in Open, OAPF, and Studio.
  - The web project on Git Hub received commits from 11 contributors over this period,
including 4 new contributors. This strong group of contributors highlights growing skills
and confidence in multiple areas of the library to directly contribute to the website.
- Spring Update:
  - Regular updates continued, with Maryelizabeth taking on the lead for deploying new
content. Timely features, such as a banner for Vandal Giving Day or fellowship openings,
were added to support Library initiatives.
  - The web project on Git Hub received 100 commits from 9 contributors during this
period, showing significant regular updates and a strong group of contributors.
  - Work was done to migrate content from old webpages server.
**Unit/Team Metrics:**
▪ % of pages reviewed by coordinators for accuracy
  - Fall: 100% of pages in navigation
▪ Web engagement statistics (as determined by team lead after evaluation)

▪ # of commits to redesign project on Git Hub
  - Fall: no commits on a new redesign yet. Work on assets update and content updates will
contribute to future project. 215 commits on current website project from 11 different
contributors.
  - Spring: no commits on a new redesign yet. 100 commits on current project from 9
contributors.
▪ Web traffic between properties and main university website
▪ % of web properties with updated library branding
  - Fall: update to Digital home page and digital collection templates brings better library
branding to those areas.
▪ Timeliness assessment for each unit – survey of unit members asking if website up-to-date
  - Fall: no survey done.
Final Outcomes 2024-25
In 2024-25 the Library Website Team has continued to develop internal skills that contribute to
sustainably maintaining a useful and useable library website. New Digital Projects Manager,
Maryelizabeth Koepele, quickly learned the workflows and infrastructure to take over as the primary
contact point to deploy regular updates to the website. Other new members learned how to navigate
the project and directly contribute, adding 4 new contributors this year who created materials such as
documentation and tutorials, in addition to updates to existing content.
Overall, we have been in a frustrating holding pattern waiting for the main university website redesign
with little communication from their team to help us understand what it will be like. Without a clear
idea of the basic pattern of their redesign, it has been difficult to imagine how our site can be
redesigned and reorganized in a way that will mirror their look and feel. The team reviewed our existing
content and made some minor reorganizations, but is stalled in a larger vision for the major project of
redesigning our site and content.
**Reflection on 2024-25 objectives:**
- Improve discoverability of library content
  - As part of the complete content review, numerous small changes were made to
clarify information and organization across the site.
  - We have been researching other sites, guidelines, and methods for gathering
feedback about library websites.
- Redesign website to match university web branding revisions
  - In holding pattern, although some work has been done to assets that should help
streamline future migration.
- Provide up to date communication and information on the website

  - The team reviewed 100% of the content listed in our navigation. Dozens of
updates were made, old content removed, broken links updated, and
organization tweaked.
  - The “Library Updates” page was regularly updated with content such as digital
collection launches, new publishing agreements, and fellowship opportunities.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
The current objectives will continue to guide work in 2025-26. Managing the redesign project will be a
major challenge (and opportunity) with the Library Website Team next year. Redesigning the website is
an opportunity to rearticulate how we communicate about the Library, but is also limited by many
constraints and requirements. We will need to balance getting meaningful feedback from the library and
stakeholders with directly actionable decision making that will support quick timelines and the complex
context of existing content. The team will need to involve many people across the library on content
work, and receive support from leadership to make key decisions on the top-level strategies.
