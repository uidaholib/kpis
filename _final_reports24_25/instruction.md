instructional practices, and the enhancement of the discoverability and usability of the library’s online
educational resources.

Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Host a series of conversations around Instruction techniques and practices among all faculty
  - Why:
▪ Improve collaboration, assessment, and understanding of instructional practices
across diverse faculty practices
  - How:
▪ Modelling this after AI sessions from January 2024, set up a series of 2-3
sessions (1-2 hours long) that cover: individual pedagogical practices, general
information literacy pedagogical ideals/theories, AI use in pedagogy going
forward, and an initial discussion of scaffolding of content/objectives
  - Success looks like:
▪ Planning, execution, and delivery of series in Fall 2024
  - Fall 2024 Update:
▪ The Instruction Team held three faculty conversations:
- Thursday, October 24

  - Topic: Scaffolding information literacy learning objectives across
the curriculum
  - Speaker: Tyler Easterbook, Director of First Year Composition
- Friday, November 8
  - Topic: Teaching methods, in-person and online, for one-shot
presentations
  - Speaker: Jen Elbek, CETL (via Zoom)
- Thursday, December 5
  - Topic: AI in information literacy instruction
  - Speakers: Bert Baumgaertner and Casey Johnson
We had attendance of the majority of faculty at each and good
engagement. With the first two, the team had faculty contribute
content during activities, and that information is available in the
Instruction Team folder.
  - Spring 2025 Update
- No new conversations were held during spring semester.
  - Final Outcomes
- The Instruction Team was successful in gathering faculty for professional development
and conversation. The faculty had not really done this type of sharing in some time. This
could be a model going forward.
Scaffold learning objectives and instructional content across lower and upper division instruction
  - Why:
▪ Improve coherence of information literacy instruction for students
▪ Improve quality and coherence of instruction practices for all faculty
  - How:
▪ Continue improving draft of charts and documents laying out levels and
types of information literacy instruction across divisions
▪ Build consensus among faculty about categories/divisions and approaches
  - Success looks like:
▪ Finalized and distributed curriculum map in use for library faculty by the
Spring Semester
- Fall 2024 Update
  - At the faculty discussion on October 24, faculty reacted to a
draft curriculum map that Norm developed from earlier content.
Small groups of faculty provided written feedback in group
documents (Faculty discussion on learning objectives October
24) The team plans to use this content and develop a public-
facing document or infographic that explains our learning
objectives across the curriculum.

- Spring 2025 Update
  - The Instruction Team discussed the charge for creating the
content regarding learning objectives in the January 2025
meeting (Instruction Team Running agenda and notes 2024-
25.docx) Dulce brought our questions and comments to the
Leadership Team. Eventually, Leadership shifted the charge for
this to become a library-wide project to create Library Literacies.
The work then moved out of the Instruction Team and is mostly
complete, but still in progress.
- Final Outcomes
  - Due in part to the Instruction Team’s previous year’s work and
fall faculty conversation on scaffolding and instructional
content, the library now has developed a solid draft of literacies
that will be important in guiding our future instructional
**objectives**
Aggregate all online instructional content into one accessible portal
  - Why:
▪ Improve coherence and discovery of online resources for students,
▪ Improve usability and access of resources for those new to using library
resources
  - How:
▪ Work with Library Website team to:
- Create a central landing page that directs students towards relevant
resources
▪ Create navigational cues throughout the website to direct students in
need to asynchronous resources
▪ Facilitate the creation of walkthroughs/tutorials for new users that offer
varied options and mediums (video, textual, interactive) for learning basic
library skills and get feedback from team and interested parties
  - Success looks like:
▪ Publish new landing page, visual cues, and resources/tutorials by the Spring
Semester
▪ Fall 2024 update
- On Monday, September 9 (see Instruction Team Running agenda and
notes 2024-25.docx) the team discussed the work completed during the
summer by Hanwen and Norm. We made comments and determined
that the next step should be to take the proposal to the Web Team.
- Spring 2025 Update
  - Our proposal is still awaiting the next step from the Web Team.

- Final Outcomes
  - Norm and Hanwen, in collaboration with the Instruction Team,
have developed a solid proposal for a landing page which would
improve access to our online instructional materials. Hopefully
it will be prominently linked on the revised Library website.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
- The Instruction Team worked on three major objectives this past year and feels it
accomplished a great deal. It does not seem like the team needs to take on as much
next year.
- One challenge is that we could not move forward on the instructional materials landing
page because the next step lies with the Web Team. When the web team is ready, the
Instruction Team could provide insight and input about asynchronous instructional
materials on the library website.
- Scheduling and finding enthusiasm for attendance at formal faculty conversations
can be challenging. This team believes its best use of time going forward is to
support a “community of practice” for instruction across the library faculty. This
could be set up more informally, perhaps as “brown bags” and without outside
speakers.
Unit/Team Metrics: (note progress or edit if not needed)
- Engagement with Instructional Website - not necessary right now: in progress
- # of resources gathered on aggregated page: in progress
- # of educational resources revised and/or deleted: NA
- Instructional scaffolding document : Moved to library leadership and faculty
- Instruction Discussion Series held: completed Fall 2024
