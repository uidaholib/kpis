Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
Provide orientation and instruction to Engl101 students
- Why:
  - New students will be more successful if they know about and use the resources and
services located in the library or through our website
- How:
  - Refine and implement Engl101 orientation scavenger hunt activity
  - Develop and implement Engl101 activity for students to learn how to find books and
articles and to use reference services, particularly online chat
- Success looks like:
  - The majority of groups participating in the ENGL101 activities and responding to the
survey indicate that they are aware of library resources and services and will likely
return to use them. They are also able to list resources and services that they think
will be helpful.
  - Fall 2024 update: Below are the survey results from the early fall Engl101 activities.
▪ 20 Engl101 tour times were offered, attended by 45 sections, around 852
students.
▪ 752 students completed the survey, 86% of all ENGL101 students from Fall
2024.
▪ 99.66% of respondents indicated that they would return to the library to
utilize a resource. The breakdown is as follows:

  - Spring 2025 Update
▪ 14 sections (277 students) attended tours in January 2025.
▪ In previous spring semesters, we had offered the tours as an option to
Engl101 instructors for their sections instead of requiring attendance. This
was based on previous experience indicating that many spring Engl101
students had already had a class with a library introduction in the fall.
However, we found out this no longer seemed to be true, so we decided to
schedule and require all sections to attend. When informally surveying
instructors and students, we found that most had not had Engl101 or
another library session before and quite a few were new students to the
campus. Therefore, we found that requiring these tours during the spring
semester was appreciated and effective.
▪ KPIs are collected in the fall semester for this activity so there is no updated
survey results. I am confident that the results would be similar to fall survey
results.
  - Final Outcomes
▪ This activity continues to be effective. Both students and Engl101 instructors
seem to enjoy and support it. Some questions and details need revision, but
the overall management, implementation and assessment of the activity
should proceed next year.
  - The majority of groups participating in the book and article activity indicate that
their confidence in finding books and articles in the library improved by the end of
the activity.
▪ Fall 2024 update: As this was a new activity, we expected some challenges.
Overall, it went well, with students engaging with the chat service and
locating books. We received feedback from Tyler Easterbook and Engl101
instructors. We are making some changes based on assessment for the
spring semester. One change is to make it more of a stand-alone activity,
with the goal of learning more about library organization and assistance.
The Engl101 essay following the activity will no longer contain a group
bibliography, so we will create our own topics and groups when classes
arrive.
▪ Spring 2025 Update

- 207 students in 14 sections participated in the Engl101 book
and article finding activity in spring 2025.
- After communication with the FYC director and Engl101 instructors,
we revised the book and article activity in a couple significant ways.
We decoupled it from the writing assignment as mentioned in the
fall update. This allowed more flexibility in scheduling. While it
generally is beneficial to connect library instruction with
assignments, it didn’t seem to be effective in the fall. Part of the
issue was that our activity was based on the original plan of having
students do group research, which didn’t work well in Engl101.
Therefore, by having this as a standalone activity, librarians helped
students form groups based on the attendance that day (eliminating
issues with absent students in a previously formed group). Also, we
provided topics that had been checked against books available in
our library. Groups picked a topic from a container. This made for
more successful book searches. These changes seemed very
effective. Students seemed less confused and more engaged than in
the fall and it lessened the burden on Engl101 instructors.
▪ Final Outcomes
- FYE added the book and article activity this year and it was largely
developed based on the desire of the FYC director to provide more
library research skills experience to Engl101 students. We tried to
design it so that it did not require a lot of actual instruction or
preparation for the librarians. Therefore, we used small groups to
reduce total numbers and a Qualtrics survey they could largely use
on their own. However, preparation, scheduling, monitoring,
meeting, covering chat and follow up still add up. During the class
sessions there is heavy use of the online chat service, which the FYE
librarians tried to cover. This became more of a burden than
expected. Therefore, the activity still felt like a significant addition to
the teaching load of the FYE librarians, despite the “self-directed”
approach. There needs to be some discussion and consideration of
the sustainability of this activity to decide how and whether to
continue it.
Provide integrated information literacy instruction in Engl102
- Why:
  - Empower students to develop foundational and transferable information literacy
skills
- How:
  - Collaboration with First-Year Writing Director and course instructors
  - Teach ENGL102 instruction sessions in-person and provide online equivalent
content for online sections
  - Develop and revise ENGL102 instructional content and grade library assignments
  - Support students as they complete their ENGL 102 research assignment.
- Success looks like:

  - Continued partnership with the First-Year Writing Program and Director
▪ Fall 2024 update: After collaborating with Tyler Easterbrook on changes in
our library instruction to match the new curriculum, we feel the move to link
our assignment to the now-required annotated bibliography was quite
helpful. Informal assessment indicates that it improved the relevance of our
instruction and assignment. Some instructors indicated that they needed to
adjust the timing of the library sessions in spring semester, as they had
based their fall scheduling requests on the previous curriculum.
▪ Spring 2025 Update
- The updated library unit continued to work well with the new
curriculum. Spring semester scheduling, instruction and results were
largely similar to the fall. Therefore, if the First Year Composition
program does not change its curriculum, we should continue with a
similar approach in the next academic year. Connecting the library
assignment to the annotated bibliography remains a key component
of success. In-person instruction by librarians (for in-person
sections) is also considered essential.
▪ Final Outcomes
- Our collaboration and implementation of library instruction with the
new curriculum was successful, based on instructor and librarian
feedback as well as student assignment assessment (below). For
next academic year, it will be important to meet with the FYC
director to determine if there will be any changes to the curriculum.
If not, we can retain most of the library unit (with minor revisions),
but may want to consider ways of streamlining the grading of
assignments by librarians. Grading continues to be a time
consuming task and there is some question about whether students
benefit from or take advantage of the effort librarians make in
grading.
  - Data collected indicates that the majority of students who attended ENGL 102
library sessions and submitted the assignment retained the foundational
information literacy skills taught during Library week
▪ Fall 2024 update: In fall 2024, 76% of Engl102 students (n=688) submitted a
library assignment, and 95% of those completed 75% of the answers
correctly. These numbers indicate library faculty are having a positive impact
on Engl102 students information literacy.
▪ Spring 2025 Update
- In spring 2025, 72% of Engl102 students (n=696) submitted a library
assignment, and 92% of those completed 75% of the answers
correctly. These numbers continue indicate library faculty are having
a positive impact on Engl102 students information literacy. While
the percentages are somewhat lower than in fall, there are some
differences in the population of students who take Engl102 in the
spring semester compared to fall.
▪ Final Outcomes

- While there may be some revisions needed in the assignment and in
the instruction, overall the results indicate that students are finding
the assignment worth completing and learning foundational
information literacy skills that they can apply to research for their
annotated bibliography. It also indicates that the collaboration with
the FY Composition program is effective since instructors support the
library sessions, unit and assignment and encourage their students
to participate and complete it.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year
- Our current FY instruction program continues to be high-touch, engaging and instructionally
effective.
- The instruction load (including prep, communications, Canvas management, in-person
instruction, grading and Information Landscape (IL) workshops) for FYE librarians is very high
and may not be sustainable without some changes.
- While many other library faculty teach IL workshops, the bulk of the burden for managing them
falls to FYE. This hidden work includes recruiting for and scheduling the workshops, creating
links and handouts to it, creating the attendance spreadsheets, promoting the workshops in class
announcements, recording attendance, reminding students, responding to student questions,
assigning asynchronous options, communicating with instructors, etc. We may need to find
efficiencies, perhaps in grading, IL workshop management or Engl101 activity implementation,
including alternate ways of covering chat service during the book and article activity.
- With a new team leader and new instruction librarian incoming, there may be opportunities for
new ideas and approaches.
