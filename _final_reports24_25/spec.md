Special Collections and Archives Department
Overview: The Special Collections and Archives (Spec) department supports stakeholder access
to unique and rare materials that are crucial to studying the history of the university, the state,
and the region. A significant portion of Spec’s holdings are not duplicated anywhere else in the
world, and the archives are curated to serve the needs of students, faculty, and the community.
Users of Spec holdings apply their findings to scholarly research projects, industry-driven
inquiries, university storytelling efforts, personal or family studies, and more.

Objectives (includes timebound goals and projects):
1. Curate collections that are unique and useful to patrons
- Why: Patrons to Spec are best served by collections that are thoughtfully arranged, are
related to the department’s collecting priorities, and are comprised of materials that are
not redundant to other repositories
- How: Bring intentionality to each step of the curatorial process – from donation
acceptance to weeding to arrangement; cultivate donations of materials that are unique
and compliment other holdings in the archives; use patron feedback and collection usage
data to make informed choices about what to collect in the future
- Success looks like: Developing a more detailed scope of collections that empowers
members of Spec to make decisions during processing that support departmental,
Library, and university priorities; the ability to connect patron inquiries to relevant
collection resources in Spec
- Fall Update: Over the fall semester, Spec acquired several notable collections as well as
a broad variety of materials that add to the strengths of our archive. The Kolln book
collection, that consisted of more than 1,000 volumes, is a remarkable assemblage of
books written by and about American women. For scholars of women’s history, it will be a
significant asset once fully catalogued. We partnered with the National Forest Service to
save nearly 10,000 historic images from the Kooskia Ranger Station from destruction.
Several extension offices have asked us to take possession of important records related
to 4-H and other programs organized through the University of Idaho. We added almost
100 linear feet in new accessions between Aug. 15 and the end of December.
- Spring Update: Our department continued to add meaningful collections to the Library
archives throughout the semester. One major focus of our efforts was gathering materials
from offices that were forced to close in January due to changing state rules around
diversity programs. Both physical and digital materials were gathered from now-shuttered
offices like the Women’s Center and the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Another time-
sensitive collecting initiative involved archiving U of I web properties that are likely to be
cut from the University’s website during a forthcoming redesign. The Library purchased a
subscription to Archive It in order to document webpages quickly and securely. Between
December and June, Rebecca archived 167MB of data. The process for turning that

material into accessible public-facing items is under development. Most of our collecting
in Spring ‘25 was in service to documenting University history.
2. Make collections easy to find and use
- Why: Our work is only meaningful when patrons can engage with it. Barriers to accessing
archival information should be dismantled where possible.
- How: Invest time and energy into processing collections with robust finding aids, then
sharing those via Archives West; commitment to good customer service and helping
patrons to the best of our abilities; collaborate with colleagues across the Library to think
creatively about expanding digital access to archival materials
- Success looks like: Processing all new accessions measuring less than 3 cubic feet
before shelving; devote student staff and regular staff time to processing backlog
accessions; publishing new finding aids and making updates to existing finding aids;
working closely with the Digital Collections Team to make Spec materials available online
- Fall Update: We continue to make significant progress on processing our backlogged
material. The majority of recent donations have been processed quickly, and at least one
large legacy donation was finally cataloged in the fall. A major benefit of processing older
accessions is the reduction in size of their footprint. The Lauren Fins donation, which was
originally acquired in 2008 and totaled more than 40 boxes was reduced by nearly 50%.
Over the course of the semester 70 new finding aids were added, representing newly
accessible material, and another 14 were updated for increased usability. A major effort
this fall involved creating finding aids for book collections that were otherwise absent
from Archives West, the platform we are most often directing patrons to use.
- Spring Update: During the spring, with the help of student workers and a fully staffed
department, we added 78 more finding aids to Archives West and updated more than 40
more. Many of those new finding aids reflected very recently acquired materials. We are
making good progress on decreasing lag time between donation acceptance and public
access. A few examples of complex donations that were quickly processed include a
collection of more than 1,000 political campaign buttons as well as a large set of letters
belonging to a Vandal alumnus (MA2025-03/MG 660 and MA2025-15/MG666,
respectively).
3. Demonstrate the importance of archiving and the relevance of our collections
- Why: Potential users of the archive are more likely to engage with materials if they
understand their importance and the basic principles of archiving (a.k.a. archival
intelligence)

- How: Offer instruction for students and community members; participate in workshops
both on and off campus; create displays using archival materials; publish writing in public-
facing mediums about archiving or archival materials in our collection
- Success looks like: Build and maintain relationships with faculty who integrate archival
instruction into their course; pursue outreach opportunities to connect with the campus
community and beyond; develop topical displays and write articles that highlight parts of
our collections
- Fall Update: We created two new displays during the fall to highlight archival material –
one on the Library’s 2nd floor and one in the University house. We once again provided
printed materials for the university’s Veterans Day dinner. Four more pieces were
submitted to the Moscow-Pullman Daily News for their “Nearby History” column. The
ETIL workshops led by Dulce and Kelley both highlighted the importance of archival
material, and a Graduate Student Essentials workshop also focused on archival
resources. There were 6 classroom instruction sessions offered.
- Spring Update: In a variety of ways, faculty and staff in Spec promoted the value of the
Library’s special collections and more broadly the relevance of historical primary sources.
ETIL workshops led by all three of the department’s faculty focused on archival or primary
source topics. Six classroom instruction sessions touched students in the History,
English, and Math departments. Another four profiles of U of I archival material were
carried by the local newspaper. Ten new posts were added to the Harvester blog. The
department collaborated with the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival for a display of materials
belonging to Leonard Feather, located on the Library’s second floor. Dulce took on
leadership roles in two interdisciplinary efforts – one to see the Moscow campus
designated on the NRHP and one to coordinate America250 commemorations at the
university. Both opportunities will provide venues to highlight the Library’s unique
historical collections. Lastly, the sudden closure of long-standing campus offices brought
the value of historic records to the forefront of many people’s minds. It was beneficial that
Spec had a standing relationship with some of those offices, and a reputation for good
work that made it easy to connect with those who had not interacted with our office in the
past.
Additional Reflection: Objective 1 calls for us to “use patron feedback and collection usage data
to make informed choices about what to collect in the future,” while Objective 2 calls for a
“commitment to good customer service and helping patrons to the best of our abilities.” In
service to these two objectives, we used AI to mine the data we collect in our Patron Support
Report form. Spec faculty and staff use the form to report on their interactions with patrons, and
the Reading Room interactions our student staff have are input into the form as well.
Here is comprehensive analysis: AI Analysis of Patron Interactions.docx

The key takeaways that are most useful to consider moving into the next year are as follows.
- Metadata accuracy: the highly varied, user-supplied collection labels argue for
tightening controlled vocabulary in the inquiry form (auto-suggest or drop-downs) to
reduce ambiguity.
- Outreach: with scholarly researchers, genealogists, and students comprising most
activity, tailored online guides for those segments could reduce reference e-mail
volume and speed triage.
Final Outcomes: The biggest measurable achievements of the Spec department over the last
year include the number of new finding aids added to Archives West, the number of new
donations we accepted and processed, and the number of patrons we served with a wide variety
of needs. Important efforts were made to better organize our archival storage so that like
materials were housed together. Student staff were trained and managed to increase our
processing productivity as well as maintain robust public hours in the Reading Room. New
investments in digital archiving allowed for important acquisitions and the ability to respond
quickly to the needs of campus partners.
The most important achievement of the department, however, is more difficult to measure. As a
group of faculty and staff, we have developed strong working relationships that support
collaboration and collegiality. There is open communication which makes problem solving not
just routine but enjoyable. The trust and respect that is being built in Spec makes it easier to
tackle long-standing challenges and approach projects with enthusiasm and a plan.
Challenges and Opportunities for Next Year: A recent report from the state’s insurance
provider outlined some significant changes that need to be made to our physical storage spaces
within the next several months. This will take teamwork, both to find a solution to the identified
problems and physically because of the volume of shifting that will need to take place. Space –
how much we have, how we use it, and how we can augment it to make it safer for our collections
– continues to be one of the biggest challenges we face in Spec.
A great deal of work has been completed over the last year to establish how we preserve and
access digital archival material, and that should be counted as an accomplishment. As we wrap
up our second year of having a full-time Digital Archivist (and Rebecca marks one year on the job),
we have opportunities to refine our collecting and management protocols for born-digital
materials. We also have an obligation to consider how to integrate AI tools into our department’s
work. Having a representative on the Library’s AI working group/team will help us meet that
obligation.
