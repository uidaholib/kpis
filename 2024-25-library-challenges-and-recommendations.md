## Team Performance Analysis and Organizational Challenges

*Note: Organizational structure distinguishes between permanent Units (Unit heads, stable functions) and malleable Teams (rotating leadership, flexible goals) per [teams-units.csv](_data/teams-units.csv)*

### Teams Facing Performance Challenges

#### Open Strategies Team - Declining Impact
**Performance Issues** ([Open Strategies report](_final_reports24_25/open-strategies.md)):
- **Zero new Think Open Fellowships** awarded in 2024-25
- **"Big drop off in marked courses"** due to inability to conduct outreach 
- Team **"deemphasizing cost savings and volume"** of core programs
- **"Less organic interest than in previous peak years"**

**Analysis**: As a Team (not permanent Unit), Open Strategies appears to have completed its primary mission cycle. Core open access functions could be redistributed to permanent Units.

#### Discovery Team - Limited Implementation
**Performance Issues** ([Discovery report](_final_reports24_25/discovery.md)):
- **Tested 7 Primo VE features but implemented none**
- **"Cannot move forward on some objectives due to dependencies on other teams"**
- Instructional materials landing page "still awaiting action from Web Team"

**Analysis**: Team functions appear duplicative of permanent Unit capabilities in ATS and DSOS.

#### Liaisons Team - Objective Achievement Challenges
**Performance Issues** ([Liaisons report](_final_reports24_25/liaisons.md)):
- **Failed to interact with 15 departments** across multiple colleges
- **Received only one feedback request** despite advertising services
- **"Due to lack of interest and complexity of tracking"** moved away from formal metrics
- Collections Team reports **minimal liaison feedback** on acquisitions

**Analysis**: Team shifted to "mostly informational/social group" model, suggesting structural rather than performance issues.

### Unit-Level Challenges

#### REL Unit - Service Component Concerns
**Data Hub Performance Issues** ([REL report](_final_reports24_25/rel.md)):
- **"Data Hub hasn't been able to grow question base consistently"**
- **"Inconsistent attendance"** at Tech Talks
- **"Question whether working Data Hub desk shifts diminishes staff productivity"**
- **Data management consultations down** in 2024 from 2023
